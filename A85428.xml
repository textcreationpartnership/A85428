         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat the ſcope of this treatiſe it ſelfe is,
the <hi>Title-page</hi> and the <hi>Table</hi> that
followes, will ſufficiently informe you:
I ſhall onely here acquaint you, with what
was mine, in a few words. I have by long
experience obſerved many holy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ſoules, who have clearely and wholly given up
themſelves to Chriſt, to be ſaved by him his owne way;
And who at their firſt converſion (as alſo at times of
deſertion,) have made an entire and immediate cloze
with Chriſt alone for their Juſtification, who yet in the
ordinary courſe and way of their ſpirits, have beene too
much carried away with the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of Chriſt in
their owne hearts, and not <hi>after Chriſt</hi> himſelfe:
The ſtreame of their more conſtant thoughts and dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
intentions running in the channell of reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſearching into the gracious diſpoſitions of their
owne hearts, ſo to <hi>bring down,</hi> or to <hi>raiſe up</hi> (as the
Apoſtles words are, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8.) and ſo get a ſight of
Chriſt by them. Whereas Chriſt himſelfe is <hi>nigh them</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:155276:3"/>
(as the Apoſtle there ſpeakes) if they would but nakedly look
upon himſelfe through thoughts of pure and ſingle faith.</p>
                  <p>And although the uſe of our owne graces by way of
ſigne and evidence of Chriſt in us be allowed us by
God, and is no way derogatory from Chriſt, if ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
to faith; and ſo as that the heart be not too inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and immoderate in poring too long, or too much on
them, to fetch their comfort from them, unto a neglect of
Chriſt: yet as pleaſures that are lawfull, are unlawfully
uſed, when our thoughts and intentions are too long, or
too frequent, or too vehement in them, ſo as to dead
the heart; either to the preſent delighting in God, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
after him, with the joint ſtrength of our ſoules, as
our onely chiefeſt good: ſo an immoderate recourſe unto
ſignes, (though barely conſidered as ſuch) is as unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable,
when thereby we are diverted and taken off
from a more conſtant actuall exerciſe of daily thoughts of
faith towards Chriſt immediately, as he is ſet forth to be
our righteouſnes; either by the way of <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> (which
is a kind of enjoyment of him,) or <hi>Recumbency</hi> and
renewed <hi>Adherence</hi> in purſuit after him.</p>
                  <p>And yet the minds of many are ſo wholly taken up
with their own hearts, that (as the Pſalmiſt ſayes of God)
<hi>Chriſt is ſcarce in all their thoughts:</hi> But let theſe
conſider what a diſhonour this muſt needs be unto Chriſt,
that his traine and favourites (our graces) ſhould have
a fuller Court and more frequent attendance from our
hearts then himſelfe, who is <hi>the King of Glory.</hi> And
likewiſe what a ſhame alſo it is for beleevers themſelves,
who are his Spouſe, to look upon their Husband no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
but by reflection and at ſecond hand, through the
intervention and aſsiſtance of their own graces, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators
between him and them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:155276:3"/>
Now to rectifie this errour, the way is not wholly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
all uſe of ſuch evidences, but to order them; both for
the <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> as alſo the <hi>iſſue</hi> of them: For the <hi>reaſon,</hi> ſo
as that the uſe of them goe not before, but ſtill ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after an addreſſe of faith firſt renewed, &amp; acts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
put forth upon Chriſt himſelfe. Thus whenſoever wee
would goe downe into our owne hearts, and take a view of
our graces, let us be ſure firſt to looke wholly out of our
ſelves unto Chriſt, as our juſtification, and to cloze
with him immediately; and this as if we had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
or by paſt grace, to evidence our being in
him. And if then whilſt faith is thus immediately claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
about Chriſt, as ſitting upon his Throne of Grace, we
finde either preſent or fore-paſt graces comming in as
Hand-maids, to attend and witneſſe to the truth of this
adherence unto Chriſt, (as after ſuch ſingle and abſolute
acts of faith, it oftentimes falls out.) The Holy Ghoſt
(without whoſe light they ſhine not) <hi>bearing witneſſe
with our ſpirits,</hi> that is, our graces, as well as to our
ſpirits. And then againe, for the <hi>iſſue</hi> of them, if in the
cloſure of all, we again let fall our viewing and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our ſelves in them, or this their teſtimony, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
afreſh (upon this encouragement) to act faith upon
Chriſt immediately with a redoubled ſtrength: if thus (I
ſay) we make ſuch evidences to be ſubſervient onely unto
faith, (whilſt it makes Chriſt its <hi>Alpha</hi> &amp; <hi>Omega,</hi> the
beginning and end of all) this will be no prejudice at all
to Chriſts glory or the workings of faith it ſelfe; for by
this courſe the life of faith is ſtill actually maintained,
and kept upon wing in its full ure, and exerciſe towards
Chriſt alone for juſtification. Whereas many Chriſtians
doe habitually make <hi>that</hi> onely but as a ſuppoſed or taken
<pb facs="tcp:155276:4"/>
for granted principle, which they ſeldome uſe, but have
laid up for a time of need: But <hi>actually</hi> live more in
the view and comfort of their owne graces, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
workings thereof in duties towards Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of this defect among many other I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
partly to a <hi>Barrennes</hi> (as <hi>Peters</hi> phraſe is) <hi>in
the knowledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of ſuch
things revealed about him, as might be matter for faith
to worke and feede upon: As alſo to a want of skill (whilſt
men want aſſurance) to bend and bow, and ſubjugate to the
uſe of a <hi>faith of meere adherence,</hi> all thoſe things
that they know and heare of Chriſt as made juſtification
unto us. It being in experience a matter of the greateſt
difficulty, (and yet certainly moſt feaſable and attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
for ſuch a faith, as can yet onely relie &amp; caſt it ſelf
upon Chriſt for juſtification, yet rightly to take in, and
ſo to make uſe of all that which is or may be ſaid of Chriſt
his being made righteouſneſſe to us, in his <hi>Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
&amp;c.</hi> as to quicken and ſtrengthen it ſelfe in
ſuch acts of meere <hi>Adherence,</hi> untill <hi>Aſſurance</hi> it ſelfe
comes, for whoſe uſe and entertainment all ſuch truths lie
more fair and directly to be received by it. They all ſerve
as a fore-right wind to <hi>aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of faith,</hi> to fil the ſails
thereof, &amp; carry it on with a more full and conſtant gale,
(as the word uſed by the Apoſtle for <hi>Aſſurance</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports)
whereas to the faith of a poore recumbent, they
ſerve but as a halfe-ſide-wind, unto which yet,
through skill, the ſailes of ſuch a faith may be ſo turned
and applyed towards it, as to carry a ſoule on with much
eaſe and quietneſſe unto Chriſt, the deſired Haven; It not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
waiting all that while, for a more faire and
full gale of aſſurances in the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:155276:4"/>
Now to helpe or inſtruct beleevers in that latter, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the uſe of ſuch a skill, is not ſo directly the drift of
this Treatiſe, I having reſerved that part (if God aſsiſt
me and give leiſure, and this find acceptance) unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about the <hi>acts of juſtifying Faith,</hi> wherein this
art now mentioned is to be the maine ſcope. That which
I have here endeavoured, is, to ſet forth to all ſorts of
beleevers (whether they have aſſurance or not) <hi>Chriſt
as he is the Object of our faith as juſtifying,</hi> and as
the cauſe of juſtification to us; and ſo I ſend forth this
as a premiſe and preparatory to that other. And to that
purpoſe I have run over ſome few <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi>
or Creede, as I found them put together in one bundle
by the great Apoſtle, namely Chriſt, in his <hi>Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
Aſcenſion, Sitting at Gods right hand,</hi>
and <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> and have handled theſe no further,
then as in all theſe he is made <hi>Juſtification</hi> unto us,
therin having punctually kept unto the Apoſtles ſcope. By
all which you may (in the mean time) ſee, what abundant
proviſion God hath laid up in Chriſt (in the point of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification)
for all ſorts of beleevers to live upon: Every
thing in Chriſt, whatſoever he <hi>was,</hi> or whatſoever he
<hi>did,</hi> with a joynt voice ſpeaking juſtification unto us.
You may ſee alſo that God hath in Chriſt juſtified us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and over; and thereby come to diſcerne what little
reaſon you have to ſuffer your hearts to be carried aſide
to other comforters, and ſo be <hi>ſpoiled</hi> and bereft of theſe
more immediately prepared, and laid up for us in Chriſt
himſelfe. To have handled all thoſe conſiderations, which
his <hi>obedience unto death</hi> affords unto the juſtification
of a beleever, and his comfort therein, in this ſmall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate,
would have made that part too diſproportioned to
<pb facs="tcp:155276:5"/>
the reſt: it alone deſerves, &amp; will require a diſtinct Tract,
which therefore I have caſt into another method; and ſo
in this Treatiſe have toucht only upon what may for the
preſent be ſufficient to furniſh that part, to keep company
with its fellows. Onely when I had thus preſented Chriſt
along <hi>from</hi> his <hi>Death, Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi>
unto his <hi>Sitting in Heaven,</hi> and there performing that
great part of his Prieſthood, the worke of <hi>Interceſſion,</hi>
I judged it both homogeneall to all theſe, and conducing
to the greater encouragement of beleevers in the exerciſe
of their faith, to ſubjoyne that other Treatiſe, <hi>How
Chriſts Heart now he is in Heaven ſtands affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to us ſinners here below.</hi> And a better token,
(take the Arument it ſelfe, if I could have fully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it) how to preſent unto his Spouſe I know not, then
a true <hi>character</hi> of her <hi>Husbands heart</hi> now he is in
glory: And (but for methods ſake) I would have placed
it firſt, it being more ſuited to vulgar capacities, whoſe

there, and ſpoken of Gods juſtifying him; and
theſe are every Beleevers words here, intended
of Gods juſtifying them. Chriſt is brought in
there uttering them as ſtanding at the High
Prieſts Tribunall, when they <hi>ſpat</hi> upon him, and
<hi>buffeted</hi> him, as <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. when he was condemned

                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. He had a faith for the juſtification of himſelfe.</note> in ſome ſenſe he had a <hi>faith for Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
like unto ours, though not a <hi>Iuſtification through
faith,</hi> as we have. He went not, indeed, <hi>out of
himſelfe,</hi> to rely to another for righteouſneſſe,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155276:13"/>
for he had enough of his owne (he being <hi>The Lord
our righteouſneſſe:</hi>) yet he beleeves on God to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him, and had recourſe to God for juſtification:
<hi>He is neer</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that juſtifies me.</hi> If he had ſtood
in his own perſon meerely, and upon his owne
bottome onely, there had beene no occaſion for
ſuch a ſpeech; and yet conſider him as he ſtood in
our ſtead, there was: for what need of ſuch a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
if he had not been ſome way neer a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation?
He therefore muſt be ſuppoſed to
ſtand here (in <hi>Eſay)</hi> at Gods Tribunall, as well as at
<hi>Pilates,</hi> with all our ſins upon him: And ſo the ſame
Prophet tels us <hi>Ch. 53. 6. God made the iniquities of us
to meete on him.</hi> He was now made <hi>ſin,</hi> and a <hi>curſe,</hi>
and ſtood not in danger of <hi>Pilates</hi> condemnation
only, but of Gods too, unleſſe he ſatisfied him for
all thoſe ſins. And when the wrath of God for ſin
came thus in upon him, his faith was put to it, to
truſt &amp; wait on him for his Juſtification, for to take
off all thoſe ſins, together with his wrath from off
him, and to acknowledg himſelfe ſatisfied, &amp; him
acquited. Therfore in the 22. <hi>Pſ.</hi> (which was made
for Chriſt when hanging on the Croſſe, and ſpeaks
how his heart was taken up that while) he is
brought in as putting forth ſuch a faith as here we
ſpeak of, when he called God his God, [<hi>My God my
God</hi>] then, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as to his ſenſe, he had <hi>forſaken him,
[why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>] Yea he helped his faith
with the faith of the Fore-fathers, whom upon
their truſt in him God had delivered: <hi>Our Fathers,</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>truſted in thee; they truſted and thou didſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them:</hi> Yea, at the 5. <hi>v.</hi> we find him laying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155276:14"/>
at Gods feet, lower then ever any man did,
[<hi>I am a worme</hi>] (ſayes he) (which every man treads
on, and counts it a matter of nothing for to kill)
[<hi>and no man</hi>] as it follows; and all this, becauſe he
<hi>bare our ſins.</hi> Now his deliverance and juſtification
from all theſe, to be given him at his reſurrection,
was the matter, the buſineſſe he thus truſted in
God for, even that he ſhould riſe again, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited
from them. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. (a Pſalme made
alſo for Chriſt, when to ſuffer, and to lie in the
grave) <hi>ver. 8, 9, 10. The Lord is at my right hand, I
ſhall not be moved: Therefore my heart is glad, my
fleſh alſo reſteth in hope,</hi> Or (as in the Originall)
[<hi>dwels in confident ſureneſſe] thou wilt not leave [my
ſoule] in hell,</hi> that is under the load of theſe ſins,
and thy wrath laid on me for them) <hi>neither wilt
thou ſuffer thy holy One</hi> (in my body) <hi>to ſee corruption.</hi>
This is in ſubſtance all one with what is here ſaid
in this one word, <hi>He is neere that [juſtifies] me,</hi> for
Chriſts <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was a <hi>Iuſtification</hi> of him, as I
ſhall hereafter ſhew.</p>
                     <p>Neither 2.<note place="margin">2. A faith for the juſtifying of us.</note> did he exerciſe faith for himſelfe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but for us alſo; and that more then any of us is
put to it, to exerciſe for himſelfe: for he in dying,
and emptying himſelfe, truſted God with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of all his ſufferings aforehand, there being
many thouſands of ſoules to be ſaved thereby a
long while after, even to the end of the world. He
dyed and betruſted all that ſtock into his Fathers
hands, to give it out in Grace and Glory, as thoſe
for whom he dyed ſhould have neede. And this is
a greater truſt (conſidering the infinite number of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155276:14"/>
his elect, as then yet to come) then any man hath
occaſion to put forth for himſelfe alone. God tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
Chriſt before he came into the world, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
many millions of the Jews upon his bare word:
And then Chriſt, at his death, truſts God againe
as much, both for the ſalvation of Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
that were to beleeve after his death. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.
12, 13, 14, 15. it is made an Argument, that Chriſt
was a man like us, becauſe he was put to live by
faith like as we are (which the angels doe not) and
to this end, the Apoſtle brings in theſe words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied
of him, as ſpoken by him of himſelfe,
[<hi>I will put my truſt in him</hi>] as one proofe that he
was a man like unto us. Now for what was it that
he truſted God? By the Context it appeares to be
this, that he ſhould be the ſalvation of his <hi>brethren</hi>
and <hi>children,</hi> and that he <hi>ſhould have a ſeede and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
to ſerve him,</hi> and raiſe up a Church to God
to praiſe him in. For this is made his confidence
and the iſſue of his ſufferings in that fore-cited
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. from <hi>ver.</hi> 22. to the end.</p>
                     <p>How ſhould the conſideration of theſe things
both <hi>draw us on</hi> to faith,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vſe.</hi> To draw on to faith, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us therein.</note> and <hi>encourage</hi> us therein,
and <hi>raiſe</hi> up our hearts above all doubtings and
withdrawings of ſpirit in beleeving! For in this
example of Chriſt we have the higheſt inſtance of
beleeving that ever was. He truſted God (as we
have ſeene) for himſelfe, and for many thouſands
beſides, even for all his elect; and haſt not thou
the heart to truſt him for one poore ſoule? Yea
Chriſt thus truſted God, upon his ſingle Bond; but
we for our aſſurance, have both Chriſt and God
bound to us, even God with his ſurety, Chriſt,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155276:15"/>
(for he is Gods Surety as well as ours.) A double
Bond from two ſuch Perſons, whom would it not
ſecure? If God the Father and God the Son thus
mutually truſted one another for our ſalvation,
whom would it not induce to truſt them both, for
ones own ſalvation, when as otherwiſe they muſt
be damned that will not? 1. This example of
Chriſt may teach and incite us to beleve: For did
Chriſt lay downe all his glory, and empty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and leave himſelfe worth nothing, but made
a Deed of Surrendring all he had into his Fathers
hands, and this in a pure truſt that God would <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
many by him,</hi> (as it is in <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. and ſhall not
we lay downe all we have, and part with what
ever is deare unto us afore hand, with the like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
in a dependance and hope of being our

encourage us to beleeve: Haſt thou the guilt of
innumerable tranſgreſſions comming in, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
thee from truſting in him? Conſider
but what Chriſt had, (though not of his owne:)
Chriſt was made (as <hi>Luther</hi> boldly (in this ſenſe
that we ſpeak of him) ſpeakes) <hi>the greateſt ſinner</hi>
that ever was; that is, by imputation: for the ſins
of all Gods choſen met in him: And yet he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
God to be juſtified from them all, and to be
raiſed up from under the wrath due of them. Alas,
thou art but one poore ſinner, &amp; thy faith hath but
a light and ſmal load laid upon it, namely, thy own
ſins, which to this ſumme he undertook for, are
but as an unite to an infinite number: <hi>God laid upon
him the iniquities of us all.</hi> Chriſt truſted God for his
own Acquitance from the ſins of all the world, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155276:15"/>
when that was give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, he yet again further truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, to acquit the <hi>world</hi> for his ſatisfaction ſake.</p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ſay, Chriſt was Chriſt, one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
united to God, and ſo knew that he could
ſatisfie him; but I am a ſinfull man. Well, but if
thou beleeveſt, and ſo art one of thoſe who are
one with Chriſt, then Chriſt ſpeaking theſe words
in the name both of himſelfe and of his Elect, (as
hath been ſhewed) thou haſt the very ſame ground
to utter them that he had, and all that encouraged
him, my embolden thee, for he ſtood in thy
ſtead. It was onely thine, and others ſins that put
him in any danger of condemnation; and thou
ſeeſt what his confidence before-hand was, that
God would juſtifie him from them all: And
if he had left any of them unſatisfied for, he had
not been juſtified; and withall in performing his
own part undertaken by him, he performed thine
alſo, and ſo in his being juſtified, thou wert juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
alſo: His <hi>confidence then,</hi> may therefore be thine
<hi>now:</hi> onely <hi>his</hi> was <hi>in</hi> and from <hi>himſelfe,</hi> but <hi>thine</hi>
muſt be <hi>on him:</hi> yet ſo, as by reaſon of thy <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
with him in his both <hi>condemnation</hi> and <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
thou mayſt take &amp; turn all that emboldned
him to this his truſt and confidence, to embolden
thee alſo in thine, as truly as he did for himſelfe.
Yea in this thou haſt now a farther prop and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to thy faith, then he then had; for
<hi>now</hi> (when thou art to beleeve) Chriſt hath <hi>fully
performed</hi> the ſatisfaction he undertooke; and we
<hi>now ſee Ieſus crucified,</hi> acquited, yea <hi>crowned with
glory and honour,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks: But he,
when he took up this <hi>triumph,</hi> was (as <hi>Eſay</hi> here
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155276:16"/>
foretold and prophecyed it of him) but as then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
upon that work. The Prophet <hi>ſeeing the day</hi> of
his arraignment and Agonie, utters theſe words as
his; ſhewing what thoughts ſhould then poſſeſſe
his heart, when <hi>Pilate</hi> &amp; the Jews ſhould condemn
him, and our ſins come in upon him, <hi>God is neere
that juſtifies me, who</hi> therefore <hi>ſhall contend with me?</hi>
But now this comes to be added to <hi>our</hi> challenge
here, that <hi>Chriſt HATH dyed, and is</hi> alſo <hi>riſen again;</hi>
that he <hi>WAS</hi> condemned &amp; juſtified, <hi>who</hi> therefore
<hi>ſhall condemne?</hi> may we ſay, and ſay much more.</p>
                     <p>But thou wilt yet ſay, He knew himſelfe to be
the <hi>Son of God,</hi> but ſo doe not I. Well, doe thou
but caſt thy ſelfe upon him, to be adopted and
juſtified by him, with <hi>a giving up thy ſoule</hi> to <hi>his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
thee <hi>his owne way,</hi> and (though thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
it not) the thing is done. And as for that (ſo
great and uſuall) <hi>diſcouragement</hi> unto poore ſoules
from doing this, namely, the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> and <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of ſins,</hi> this very <hi>example</hi> of <hi>his faith,</hi> and the
conſideration of it, may alone take off, and help to
remove it, more then any I have ever met with:
for <hi>He</hi> in bearing the ſins of his Elect, did beare
as great and infinitely more ſins then thine, yea, all
ſorts of ſins what ever, for ſome one of his elect or
other, (for he ſaid upon it, that <hi>All</hi> (that is, all ſorts
of) <hi>ſins ſhall be forgiven unto men,</hi> &amp; therefore were
<hi>firſt born by him</hi> for them) and yet you ſee how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
afore-hand he was, &amp; is now clearly juſtified
from them all: And by vertue of <hi>his</hi> being <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
from <hi>all ſorts of ſins,</hi> ſhall <hi>all ſorts of ſinners in</hi> and
<hi>through him</hi> be <hi>juſtified</hi> alſo: and therefore why
mayſt not thou hope to be from thine? certainly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:155276:16"/>
for this very reaſon our ſins ſimply and alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
can be ſuppoſed no hinderance.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have met with one great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
encouragement at the very Portall of this
Text, which comes forth to invite us ere we are

throughout all that ſhall be ſaid, and have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
into our faith, and helpe to direct it in all

as we have ſeene Chriſts <hi>faith for us,</hi> ſo now let
us ſee what <hi>our faith</hi> is to be <hi>towards him:</hi> Onely
take this along with you, for a right bounding of
all that follows; That <hi>the Faith</hi> (the object and

<hi>Faith as juſtifying;</hi> for Juſtification was properly
here the matter of Chriſts faith for us, and is alſo
anſwerably here held forth by <hi>Paul,</hi> as that faith
which Beleevers are to have on <hi>him.</hi> Now faith is
called <hi>juſtifying,</hi> onely as it hath <hi>Juſtification</hi> for

its object, and as it goes out to Chriſt for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
So that all that ſhall be ſpoken muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined

and therein I ſhall fulfill the Texts ſcope.</p>
                     <p>1. Direct your faith to Chriſt, as to its right object.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>To encourage your faith, from theſe ſeverall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

matter of triumph for faith in them, &amp; alſo teach
your faith how to triumph from each of them: &amp;
herein I am to keepe cloſe to the argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,

Reſurrection have an influence) yet here we are

Reſurrection, &amp;c. may, and doe afford matter of

Firſt,<note place="margin">1. As in joynt commiſſion with God the Father.</note> Chriſt is the object of faith, in joynt
commiſſion with God the Father. So here, <hi>It is
God that juſtifies,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt that dyed:</hi> They are
both of them ſet forth as the foundation of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
confidence. So elſewhere, Faith is called
<hi>a beleeving on him</hi> (namely, God) <hi>that juſtifies the
ungodly, Rom.</hi> 4. 5. and <hi>a beleeving on Chriſt, Acts</hi> 6.
Wherefore faith is to have an eye unto both,<note place="margin">Faith to eye both God and Chriſt in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for
both doe alike contribute unto the juſtification of
a ſinner. It is Chriſt that paid the price, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the righteouſneſſe by which we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified;
and it is God that accepts of it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
it unto us: Therefore Juſtification is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
unto both. And this we have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24.
where it is attributed unto them both together,
[<hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
that is in Ieſus Chriſt:</hi>] Where we ſee,
that Gods free grace, and Chriſts righteouſneſſe,
doe concur to our juſtification. Chriſt paid as
full a price, as if there were no grace ſhewne in
juſtifying of us; (for mercy bated Chriſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing)
and yet that it ſhould be accepted for us,
is as free grace, and as great, as if Chriſt had
paid never a farthing. Now as both theſe meet
to juſtifie us, ſo faith in juſtification is to look at
both theſe: So it followes in the next <hi>ver.</hi> of
that 3.<note place="margin">Yet God the ultimate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note> 
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 25. [<hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a
propitiation [through faith] in his bloud.</hi>] And
though it be true, that God juſtifying is the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
object of our faith, (for Chriſt <hi>leads us by
the hand</hi> (as the word is, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 18) <hi>unto God:</hi>
and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. we are ſaid <hi>by Chriſt to beleeve
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:155276:18"/>
on God who raiſed him, that ſo our faith and hope
might be on God</hi>)<note place="margin">Chriſt, under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, the more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate object.</note> yet ſo, as under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
Chriſt is made the more immediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of faith; for God dwelling in our nature is
made more familiar to our faith then the Perſon
of the Father is, who is meerly God. Under the
Old Teſtament, when Chriſt was but in the
Promiſe, and not as then come in the fleſh, then
indeed their faith had a more uſuall recourſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, who had promiſed the Meſſiah, of
whom they then had not ſo diſtinct (but onely
confuſed) thoughts; though this they knew,
that God accepted, and ſaved them through the
Meſſiah: But now under the New Teſtament,
becauſe Chriſt, as Mediator, exiſts not onely in
a promiſe of Gods, but is come, and manifeſt
in the fleſh, and is <hi>ſet forth by God,</hi> (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
phraſe is) to tranfact all our buſineſſes for
us betweene God and us. Hence the more uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and immediate addreſſe of our faith is to be
made unto Chriſt; who as he is diſtinctly ſet
forth in the New Teſtament, ſo he is as diſtinctly
to be apprehended by the faith of beleevers. <hi>Ye
beleeve in God,</hi> (ſayes Chriſt to his Diſciples,
whoſe faith and opinion of the Meſſiah was till
Chriſts Reſurrection, of the ſame elevation with
that of the Old-Teſtament-beleevers) <hi>beleeve
alſo in me:</hi> Make Me the object of your truſt for
Salvation, as well as the Father. And therefore
when <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> come more narrowly
to be diſtinguiſhed by their more immediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
it is <hi>Repentance towards God,</hi> but <hi>Faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:155276:19"/>
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, Act.</hi> 20. 21. not but
that God and Chriſt are the objects of both, but
that Chriſt is more immediately the object of
Faith, and God of Repentance: So that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in God through beleeving in Chriſt firſt,
and turne to Chriſt by turning to God firſt. And
this is there ſpoken, when they are made the
ſumme of Chriſtian doctrine, and of the Apoſtles
preaching: And therefore the faith of ſome
being much enlarged to the mercies of God and
his free grace, and but in way of ſuppoſition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt, or in a taking for granted, that all
mercies are communicated in and through
Chriſt, yet ſo, as their thoughts work not ſo
much upon, nor are taken up about Chriſt; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this may be true faith under the New
Teſtament, in that God and his free grace is
the joynt object of faith, together with Chriſt
and his righteouſneſſe, and the one cannot be
without the other, and God oft-times doth more
eminently pitch the ſtreame of a mans thoughts
in one chanell rather then in another, and ſo may
direct the courſe of a mans thoughts towards his
free grace, when the ſtreame runs leſſe towards
Chriſt, yet it is not ſuch a faith as becomes the
times of the Goſpel; it is of an Old-Teſtament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine
and <hi>Genius:</hi> whereas our faith now, ſhould
in the more direct and immediate exerciſes of it,
be pitcht upon Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>through him</hi>
(firſt apprehended) <hi>our faith might be in God,</hi> (as
the ultimate object of it) as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.
And ſo much for the firſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:155276:19"/>
The ſecond is,<note place="margin">2. Chriſt the object of faith in oppoſition to all in our ſelves.</note> that Chriſt is to be the object
of our faith, in oppoſition to our owne Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Graces, or Duties.</p>
                     <p>1. We are not to truſt,<note place="margin">1. Not to reſt in humiliation.</note> nor reſt in Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as many doe, who quiet their conſciences
from this, that they have been troubled. That
Promiſe, [<hi>Come to me you that are weary and heavy
laden, and you ſhall find reſt</hi>] hath been much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken;
for many have underſtood it, as if
Chriſt had ſpoken peace and reſt ſimply unto
that condition, without any more adoe; and ſo
have applyed it unto themſelves, as giving them
an intereſt in Chriſt: Whereas it is onely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitement
of ſuch (becauſe they are moſt apt to
be diſcouraged) to come unto Chriſt, as in whom
alone their reſt is to be found. If therefore men
will ſet downe their reſt in being <hi>weary and heavy
laden,</hi> and not come to Chriſt for it, they ſit down
beſides Chriſt, and will lye downe in ſorrow.
This is to make <hi>Iohn</hi> (who onely prepared the
way for Chriſt) to be the Meſſiah indeed, (as
many of the Jews thought) that is, to think the
eminent work of <hi>Iohns</hi> Miniſterie (which was to
humble, and ſo prepare men for Chriſt) to be
their attaining Chriſt himſelfe. But if you be
<hi>weary,</hi> you may have reſt indeed, but you muſt
come to Chriſt firſt: For as, if Chriſt had dyed
onely, and not aroſe, we had <hi>been ſtill in our ſins,</hi>
(as it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 17.) ſo though we dye by ſin,
as ſtaine by it, (as <hi>Paul</hi> was, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 11, 12, 13.)
in his humiliation) yet if we <hi>attaine not to the
reſurrection of faith,</hi> (ſo the work of faith is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:155276:20"/>
                        <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12, 13.) we ſtill remaine in our
ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Not in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Graces.</note> we are not to reſt in graces or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
they all cannot ſatisfie our owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
much leſſe Gods Juſtice. If <hi>Righteouſneſſe
could have come</hi> by theſe, then <hi>Chriſt had dyed
in vaine,</hi> as <hi>Gal. 2. ult.</hi> What a diſhonour were it
to Chriſt, that they ſhould ſhare any of the
glory of his righteouſneſſe? were any of your
Duties crucified for you? Graces and Duties are
the Daughters of Faith, the Off-ſpring of Chriſt;
and they may in time of need indeed nouriſh
their mother, but not at firſt beget her.</p>
                     <p>In the third place,<note place="margin">3. Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the object of faith, in a diſtinction from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> Chriſts Perſon, and not
barely the <hi>Promiſes of forgiveneſſe</hi> is to be the
object of faith. There are many poore ſoules
humbled for ſin, and taken off from their owne
bottome, who, like <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, fly over all
the Word of God, to ſpy out what they may ſet
their foot upon, and eying therein many free
and gracious Promiſes, holding forth forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſins, and juſtification, they immediately
cloſe with them, and reſt on them alone, not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
for, or cloſing with Chriſt in thoſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
Which is a common error among people;
and is like as if <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove ſhould have reſted
upon the out-ſide of the Ark, and not have come
to <hi>Noah</hi> within the Ark; where though ſhe might
reſt for a while, yet could ſhe not ride out all
ſtormes, but muſt needs have periſhed there in
the end. But we may obſerve, that the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
that was given, was not a bare word ſimply
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:155276:20"/>
promiſing forgiveneſſe, or other benefits which
God would beſtow; but it was a Promiſe of
Chriſts Perſon as overcomming Satan, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
thoſe benefits, [<hi>The Seed of the woman ſhall
break the Serpents head.</hi>] So when the Promiſe
was renewed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> it was not a bare Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of bleſſedneſſe and forgiveneſſe, but of <hi>that
Seed,</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16.) in whom that
bleſſedneſſe was conveyed, [<hi>In thy Seed ſhall all
the Nations of the earth of bleſſed.</hi>] So that <hi>Abrahams</hi>
faith firſt cloſed with Chriſt in the Promiſe, and
therefore he is ſaid to <hi>ſee Chriſts day,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in embracing him: And ſo all the ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Fathers (that were Beleevers) did, more or
leſſe, in their Types and Sacraments, as appeares
by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2. And if they, then much more
are we thus to look at Chriſt, unto whom now
he is now made extant, not in Promiſes onely,
but is really incarnate, though now in heaven.
Hence our Sacraments (which are the ſeals ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the word of faith) doe primarily exhibit
Chriſt unto a Beleever, and ſo (in him) all other
Promiſes (as of forgiveneſſe, &amp;c.) are ratified and
confirmed by them. Now there is the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of them, that there is of the Promiſes of the
Goſpel, (for they preach the Goſpel to the eye, as
the Promiſe doth to the eare) and therefore as in
them the ſoule is firſt to look at Chriſt, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
him as tendered in them, and then, at the
Promiſes tendred with him in them, &amp; not to take
the Sacraments as bare ſeals of pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenes:
So (in like manner) in receiving of, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:155276:21"/>
recourſe to a Promiſe, (which is the word of
faith) we are firſt to ſeek out for Chriſt in it, as
being the foundation of it, and ſo to take hold of
the Promiſe in him. Hence Faith is ſtill expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by this its object, Chriſt, it being called
<hi>Faith on Chriſt.</hi> Thus <hi>Philip</hi> directs the Eunuch,
<hi>Acts</hi> 6.<note place="margin">How the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are the object of faith. How Chriſt in the Promiſes.</note> 31. <hi>Beleeve on the Lord Ieſus.</hi> The Promiſe
is but the casket, and Chriſt the jewell in it; the
Promiſe but the field, and Chriſt the Pearle hid
in it, and to be chiefly lookt at. The Promiſes
are the meanes <hi>by which</hi> you beleeve, not the
things <hi>on which</hi> you are to reſt. And ſo, although
you are to look at forgiveneſſe as held forth in
the Promiſe, yet you are to beleeve on Chriſt in
that Promiſe, to obtaine this forgiveneſſe. So <hi>Act.</hi>
26. 18. it is ſaid of Beleevers by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
[<hi>That they may obtaine forgiveneſſe of ſins, by
faith which is on me.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>And to clear it farther, we muſt conceive, that
the Promiſes of Forgiveneſſe are not as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
of a Prince, which meerly containe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of his royall word for pardoning, ſo as
we in ſeeking of it, doe reſt upon, and have to do
only with his word and ſeal w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have to ſhew
for it: but Gods Promiſes of pardon are made in
his Son, and are as if a Prince ſhould offer to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
a Traytor upon marriage with his child, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in, and with that pardon he offers in ſuch a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſo as all that would have pardon, muſt firſt
ſeek out for his child: and thus it is in the matter
of beleeving. The reaſon of which is, becauſe
Chriſt is the Grand Promiſe, in whom <hi>all the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:155276:21"/>
Promiſes are Yea and Amen, 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 29. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is called <hi>The Covenant, Eſay</hi> 49. 8. So that,
as it were folly for any man to think that he hath
an intereſt in an Heireſſe lands, becauſe he hath
got the writings of her eſtate into his hands,
(whereas the intereſt in the lands goes with her
perſon, and with the relation of marriage to her;
otherwiſe, without a title to her ſelfe, all the
writings will be fetcht out of his hands againe)
ſo is it with all the Promiſes; they hang all
upon Chriſt, and without him there is no intereſt
to be had in them: <hi>He that hath the Sonne, hath
life, Iohn</hi> 1. 5, 12. becauſe Life is by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
onely in <hi>him,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 11. All the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
are as Copy-hold land, which when you
would intereſt your ſelves in, you enquire upon
what Lord it holds, and you take it up of him,
as well as get the Evidences and Deeds for it
into your hands; the Lord if it will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for ſuch in paſſing his right into your
hands: Now this is the tenure of all the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
they all hold on Chriſt, in whom they are
<hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen;</hi> and you muſt take them up of
him. Thus the Apoſtles preached forgiveneſſe
to men, <hi>Acts 13. 38. Be it knowne that through this
man is preached to you the forgiveneſſe of ſins.</hi> And as
<hi>they preached,</hi> ſo we <hi>are to beleeve,</hi> as the Apoſtle
ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 11. And without this, to reſt on
the bare Promiſe, or to look to the benefit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
without eying Chriſt, is not an Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
but a Jewiſh faith, even ſuch as the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
among the Jews had, who without the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:155276:22"/>
cloſed with Promiſes, and reſted in Types to
cleanſe them, without looking unto Chriſt the
end of them, and as propounded to their faith, in
them. This is to goe to God without a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and to make the Promiſes of the Goſpel to
be as the Promiſes of the Law, <hi>Nehuſhtan,</hi> (as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>
ſaid of the <hi>Braſen Serpent</hi>) a piece of braſſe,
vaine, and ineffectuall: like the waters of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſda,
they heale not, they cleanſe not, till this
<hi>Angel of the Covenant</hi> come downe to your faith
in them: Therefore at a Sacrament, or when you
meet with any Promiſe, get Chriſt firſt downe
by faith, and then let your faith propound what
it would have, and you may have what you will
of him.</p>
                     <p>There are three ſorts of Promiſes,<note place="margin">Three ſorts of Promiſe, and how Chriſts Perſon is the object of faith in applying them all.</note> and in the
applying of all theſe, it is Chriſt that your faith
is to meet with.</p>
                     <p>1. There are <hi>abſolute</hi> promiſes, made to no
Conditions; as when Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>come to ſave
ſinners,</hi> &amp;c. Now in theſe it is plaine, that Chriſt
is the naked object of them: ſo that if you apply
not him, you apply nothing, for the onely thing
held forth in them is Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>2. There are <hi>Inviting Promiſes;</hi> as that before
mentioned, [<hi>Come to me you that are weary</hi>] The
promiſe is not to wearineſſe, but to <hi>comming</hi> to
Chriſt; they are bidden <hi>Come to him,</hi> if they will
have reſt.</p>
                     <p>3. There are <hi>Aſſuring Promiſes;</hi> as thoſe made
to ſuch and ſuch qualifications of ſanctification,
&amp;c. But ſtill what is it that is promiſed in them,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:155276:22"/>
which the heart ſhould onely eye? It is Chriſt,
in whom the ſoule reſts and hath comfort in, and
not in its grace; ſo that the ſight of a mans grace
is but a back-doore to let faith in at, to converſe
with Chriſt, whom the ſoule loves. Even as at
the Sacrament, the elements of Bread and Wine
are but outward ſignes to bring Chriſt and the
heart together, and then faith lets the outward
elements goe, and cloſeth, and treats immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
with Chriſt, unto whom theſe let the ſoule
in: So Grace is a ſigne inward, and whilſt men
make uſe of it onely as of a bare ſigne to let them
in unto Chriſt, and their rejoycing is not in it, but
in Chriſt, their confidence being pitcht upon him,
and not upon their grace; whilſt men take this
courſe, there is and will be no danger at all in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſuch uſe of ſignes: and I ſee not, but that
God might as well appoint his owne work of the
new creation within, to be as a ſigne and help to
communion with Chriſt by faith, as he did thoſe
outward elements, the works of his firſt creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
eſpecially, ſeeing in nature, the effect is a ſign
of the cauſe. Neither is it more derogatory to
free grace, or to Chriſts honour, for God to make
ſuch effects, ſignes of our union with him, then it
was to make outward ſigns of his preſence.</p>

                     <p>For the explanation of which,<note place="margin">Explained, 1. By two Directions.</note> I will
1. Give a direction or two.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:155276:23"/>
2. Shew how an encouragement, or matter of
triumph, may from hence be fetcht.</p>
                     <p>1.<note place="margin">1. Direction.</note> The firſt Direction is this, That in ſeeking
forgiveneſſe, or juſtification in the Promiſes, as
Chriſt is to be principally in the eye of your
faith, ſo it muſt be Chriſt <hi>as</hi> crucified, Chriſt <hi>as
dying,</hi> as here he is made. It was the Serpent as
lift up, and ſo looked at, that healed them. Now
this direction I give to prevent a miſtake which
ſoules that are about to beleeve, doe often run
into: For when they heare that the perſon of
Chriſt is the maine object of faith, they thus
conceive of it, that when one comes firſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
he ſhould looke onely upon the perſonall
excellencies of Grace and Glory which are in
Jeſus Chriſt, which follow upon the Hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Union; and ſo have his heart allured in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt by them onely, and cloſe with him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thoſe apprehenſions alone. But although it
be true, that there is that radicall diſpoſition in
the faith of every Beleever, which if it were
drawne forth to view Chriſt in his meere perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
excellencies abſtractively conſidered, would
cloſe with Chriſt for them alone, as ſeeing ſuch
a beauty and ſuitableneſſe in them; yet the firſt
view which an humbled ſoule alwayes doth, and
is to take of him, is of his being a <hi>Saviour,</hi> made
<hi>ſinne,</hi> and a <hi>curſe,</hi> and obeying to the death for
ſinners. He takes up Chriſt in his firſt ſight of
him, under the <hi>likenes of ſinfull fleſh,</hi> (for ſo the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
firſt repreſents him, though it holds forth
his perſonall excellencies alſo) and in that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:155276:24"/>
it is, that he is made a fit object for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
faith to truſt &amp; reſt upon, for ſalvation, which
in part diſtinguiſheth a ſinners faith whilſt here on
earth, towards Chriſt, from that viſion or ſight
which Angels and the ſouls of men have in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of him. Faith here views him not onely as
glorious at Gods right hand, (though ſo alſo) but
as crucified, as made ſin, and a curſe, and ſo reſts
upon him for pardon; but in heaven we ſhall <hi>ſee
him as he is,</hi> and be made like unto him. Take <hi>Chriſt</hi>
in his perſonall excellencies ſimply conſidered,
and ſo with them propounded as an <hi>Head</hi> to us, &amp;
he might have been a fit object for Angels and
men even without ſin to have cloſed withall; and
what an additon to their happineſſe would they
have thought it, to have him for their husband!
but yet, ſo conſidered, he ſhould have been, and
rather is, the object of <hi>love,</hi> then of <hi>faith</hi> or affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
It is therefore Chriſt that is thus excellent
in his perſon, yet farther conſidered, as clothed
with his garments of bloud, and the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a Mediator and Reconciler; it is this that
makes him ſo deſirable by ſinners, and a fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for their faith (which looks out for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
to prey and ſeize upon, though they take
in the conſideration of all his other excellencies
to allure their hearts to him, and confirme their
choice of him. Yea I ſay farther, that conſider
faith <hi>as juſtifying,</hi> that is, in that act of it which
juſtifies a ſinner; and ſo, Chriſt taken onely or
mainly in his Perſonall excellencies, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be called the object of it: But the <hi>Formalis
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:155276:24"/>
ratio,</hi> the proper reſpect or conſideration that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Chriſt the object of faith as juſtifying, muſt
neceſſarily be <hi>that</hi> in Chriſt, which doth indeed
juſtifie a ſinner; which is, his obedience unto
death. For the act and object of every habit or
facultie, are alwayes ſuited, and ſimilar each to
other; and therefore Chriſt juſtifying muſt needs
be the object of Faith juſtifying. It is true, that
there is nothing in Chriſt with which ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
act of faith in us doth not cloſe; and
from the differing conſiderations under which
faith looks at Chriſt, have thoſe ſeverall acts of
faith various denominations: As, faith that is
carryed forth to Chriſt and his perſonall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
may be called <hi>uniting</hi> faith; and faith
that goes forth to Chriſt for ſtrength of grace
to ſubdue ſinne, may (anſwerably to its object)
be called <hi>ſanctifying</hi> faith; and faith as it goes
forth to Chriſt (as dying, &amp;c.) for juſtification,
may be called <hi>juſtifying</hi> faith: For faith in that act
looks at what in Chriſt doth juſtifie a ſinner; and
therefore Chriſt conſidered as dying, riſing, &amp;c.
doth in this reſpect become the moſt pleaſing
and gratefull object to a ſoule that is humbled;
for this makes Chriſt ſuitable to him as he is
a ſinner, under which conſideration he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
upon himſelfe, when he is firſt humbled.
And therefore thus to repreſent Chriſt to Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
under the Law, was the maine ſcope of all
the Sacrifices and Types therein, <hi>All things being
purged with bloud, and without bloud there being no
remiſsion, Heb.</hi> 9. Thus did the Apoſtles alſo in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:155276:25"/>
their Sermons. So <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſeemed by the matter of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to have <hi>known nothing but Chriſt, and him</hi> as
[<hi>crucified,</hi>] 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2. as Chriſt above all, ſo Chriſt,
as crucified above all in Chriſt, as ſuiting their
condition beſt, whom he endeavoured to draw
on to faith <hi>on him.</hi> Thus in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi>
he calls his preaching among them, the
<hi>preaching of faith, Chap.</hi> 3. 2. And what was the
maine ſcope of it, but the <hi>picturing out</hi> (as the
word is) <hi>of Chriſt crucified before their eyes? ver.</hi> 1.
ſo he preached him, and ſo they received him,
and ſo they <hi>began in the ſpirit, ver.</hi> 3. And thus
alſo doe the ſeals of the Promiſes (the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
preſent Chriſt to a Beleevers eye; as
they hold forth Chriſt, (as was in the former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
obſerved) ſo Chriſt, <hi>as crucified;</hi> their
ſcope being to <hi>ſhew forth his death till be come,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. the Bread ſignifying <hi>Chriſts body bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi>
in the ſufferings of it; and the cup ſignifying
the ſufferings of his ſoule, and <hi>the pouring</hi> of it
forth <hi>unto death.</hi> And hence likewiſe, as faith
it ſelfe is called <hi>Faith on Chriſt,</hi> (as was before
obſerved) ſo it is called <hi>Faith on his bloud, Rom.</hi>
3. 24, 25. becauſe Chriſt as ſhedding his bloud
for the remiſſion of ſinnes, is the object of it:
So the words there are, [<hi>Whom God hath ordained
to be a propitiation through faith in his bloud, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his righteouſneſſe for the remiſsion of ſins.</hi>] And
look how God hath ordained and ſet forth Chriſt
in the Promiſes, under that picture of him doth
faith at firſt cloſe with him. And one reaſon ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:155276:25"/>
to the former, may be grounded on the 24.
<hi>ver.</hi> of that 3. to the <hi>Rom. Being juſtified freely by
his grace, [through the redemption that is in Chriſt</hi>]
And as (I ſhewed before, in the reaſon of the
former direction, that) all Promiſes hold of his
Perſon, as being Heire of all the Promiſes; ſo the
ſpeciall Tenure upon which forgiveneſſe of ſins
doth hold of him, is by purchaſe, and by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
that is in him. So that, as the promiſe
of forgiveneſſe refers to his perſon, ſo alſo to this
redemption that is in him. Thus both in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.
and <hi>Col.</hi> 1. [<hi>In whom we have redemption through his
bloud, even the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</hi>] His perſon
gives us title to all the promiſes, and his bloud
ſhews the tenure they hold on; a purchaſe, and
a full price, (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, an adequate price) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 6. And as <hi>ſin is the ſtrength of the Law,</hi> and of the
threatnings thereof; ſo <hi>Chriſts ſatisfaction is the
ſtrength of all the Promiſes in the Goſpel.</hi> In a word,
an humbled ſoule is to have recourſe to that
Chriſt who is now alive, and glorified in heaven,
yet to him as once crucified and made ſinne. He
is to goe to Chriſt now glorified, as the <hi>Perſon
from whom</hi> he is to receive forgiveneſſe, &amp;c. but

<hi>intent</hi> of God and Chriſt in his ſufferings, and not

It is <hi>the heart, and mind, and intent of Chriſt
in ſuffering,</hi> which faith chiefly eyeth, and which
draweth the heart on to reſt on Chriſt crucified.
When a Beleever ſees that Chriſts aime in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for poore ſinners, agrees and anſwers to the
aime and deſires of his heart, and that <hi>that</hi> was
the end of it that ſinners might have forgiveneſſe,<note place="margin">Namely, that ſinners might have forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note>
and that Chriſts heart was as full in it, to procure
it, as the ſinners heart can be to deſire it; this
draws his heart in to Chriſt, to reſt upon him:
And without this,<note place="margin">Without this, the meditation of the ſtory of his Paſſion, unprofitable.</note> the contemplation and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſtory of his ſufferings, and of the
greatneſſe of them, will be altogether unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
And yet, all (or the chiefe) uſe which
the Papiſts, and many carnall Proteſtants make
of Chriſts ſufferings, is to meditate upon, and
ſet out to themſelves the grievouſneſſe of them,
ſo to move their hearts to a relenting, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
to him, and indignation againſt the Jews for
their crucifying of him, with an admiring of his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:155276:26"/>
noble and heroicall love herein: and if they
can but get their hearts thus affected, they judge
and account this to be grace; when as it is no
more then what the like tragicall ſtory of ſome
great &amp; noble perſonage, (ful of heroicall vertues
and ingenuity, yet inhumanely and ungratefully
uſed) will work, and uſeth ordinarily to work in
ingenuous ſpirits, who read, or heare of it: yea
and this oft-times, though it be but in the way
of a fiction: Which when it reacheth no higher,
is ſo far from being faith, that it is but a carnall
and fleſhly devotion, ſpringing from fancie which
is pleaſed with ſuch a ſtorie, and the principles
of ingenuity ſtirred towards one who is of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſpirit, and yet abuſed. Such ſtories uſe to ſtir
up a principle of humanity in men, unto a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
love; which Chriſt himſelfe at his
ſuffering found fault with, as being not ſpirituall,
nor raiſed enough in thoſe women who went
weeping to ſee the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> ſo handled; <hi>Weep not
for me,</hi> (ſayes he) that is, weep not ſo much for
this, thus to ſee me unworthily handled by thoſe
for whom I dye.</p>
                     <p>And therefore accordingly as theſe ſtirrings
are but fruits of the fleſh, ſo humane inventions,
as Crucifixes, and lively repreſentations of the
ſtory of Chriſts Paſſion unto the ſight of fancy,
doe exceedingly provoke men to ſuch devotio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
meditations and affections: but they work
a bare hiſtoricall faith only, a hiſtoricall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
and an hiſtoricall love, (as I may ſo
call them.) And no other then ſuch doth the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:155276:27"/>
reading of the ſtory of it in the Word, work in
many, who yet are againſt ſuch Crucifixes.
But ſaving, juſtifying faith chiefly minds, and
is moſt taken up with the maine ſcope and drift
of all Chriſts ſufferings: for it is that in them,
which anſwers to its owne aime and purpoſe;
which is, to obtaine forgiveneſſe of ſins in Chriſt
crucified. As God looks principally at the <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
of <hi>the Spirit</hi> in prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. ſo doth faith
look principally to the <hi>meaning of Chriſt</hi> in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.
As in all other Truths a Beleever is ſaid
to <hi>have the mind of Chriſt, 1 Cor. 2. ult.</hi> ſo eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
he minds what was the mind and heart of
Chriſt in all his ſufferings. And therefore you
may obſerve, that the drift of all the Apoſtles
Epiſtles, is to ſhew the intent of Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;
how he was therein ſet forth to be a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation
for ſinne; to beare our ſinnes upon the tree;
to make our peace, &amp;c. He was made ſinne, that we
might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi> As in
like manner, the ſcope of the Euangeliſts is to
ſet forth the ſtory of them, (for that is neceſſary
to be known alſo.) And thus did that Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> chiefly ſet forth the intent of
Chriſts ſufferings for juſtification, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.
throughout the <hi>Chap.</hi> as <hi>David</hi> before had done
the ſtory of his Paſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. And thus to
ſhew the uſe and purpoſe of his ſufferings, was the
ſcope of all the Apoſtles Sermons, holding forth
the intent of Chriſts paſſion to be the juſtification
and ſalvation of ſinners: <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying,
and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt came into the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:155276:27"/>
world to ſave ſinners, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 15. and they ſtill ſet
forth what the plot was, at which God by an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
deſignment aimed at, in the ſufferings of
Chriſt, which was an end higher then men or
Angels thought on, when hee was put to
death. And thus faith takes it up, and looks at
it. And upon this doth <hi>Peter</hi> (in his Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi>
2.) pitch their faith, where having firſt ſet forth
the hainouſneſſe of their ſin in murdering <hi>the Lord
of life,</hi> then to raiſe up their hearts againe, (that ſo
ſeeing Gods end in it, they might be drawne to
beleeve,) he tellls them, that <hi>All this was done by
the determinate counſell of God, ver.</hi> 23. and that for
a farther end then they imagined, even for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſins through his Name, as in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of that Sermon he ſhews. It was not the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of the Jews, the falſeneſſe of <hi>Iudas,</hi> the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of <hi>Pilate,</hi> or the iniquity of the times he
fell into, that wrought his death, ſo much as
God his Father complotting with Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and aiming at a higher end then they did:
there was a farther matter in it; it was the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of an ancient contrivement and agreement,
whereby God made Chriſt <hi>Sinne,</hi> and laid our
ſins upon him. God <hi>was in Chriſt,</hi> (not <hi>imputing
our ſinnes</hi> to us, but) <hi>making him ſinne, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 20.
Which Covenant Chriſt came (at his time) into
the world to fulfill: <hi>Sacrifice and burnt offering thou
wouldſt not have, (Heb.</hi> 10. 5.) <hi>Loe, I come to doe thy
will,</hi> and that will was <hi>to take away ſinnes, ver.</hi> 4, 10,
12, 14, 15, 16. Theſe words Chriſt ſpake when
he took our nature, and when he came into the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:155276:28"/>
world, clothed with infirmities like unto us ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
<hi>Rom. 8. 3. God ſent his Son in the likenes of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh:</hi> Mark
that phraſe [<hi>for ſin</hi>] [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] is there put for [<hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter</hi>]
as <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 33. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>not for a good
work:</hi> That is, not becauſe <hi>of a good work, or for
a good works ſake.</hi> So here, [<hi>For ſinne</hi>] that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of ſin; ſin was the occaſion of his taking
the likeneſſe of <hi>ſinfull fleſh:</hi> what, to encreaſe it?
no, but to <hi>condemne</hi> it, as it follows: that is, to caſt
and overthrow it in its power and plea againſt us;
that inſtead of ſins condemning us, he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
ſin, and that we might have <hi>the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Law, ver.</hi> 5. This phraſe [<hi>for ſinne</hi>]
is like unto that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 10. [<hi>He dyed unto ſinne</hi>]
that is, for ſins cauſe; for ſo the oppoſition that
follows, evinceth, [<hi>In that he liveth, he liveth unto
God</hi>] that is, for God and his glory. So he dyed
meerly for ſin, that ſin might have its courſe in
Juſtice, and for its ſake ſuffered death, ſo put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to ſilence the clamour of it. The death of
Chriſt was the greateſt and ſtrangeſt deſign that
ever God undertook, and acted; and therefore
ſurely had an end proportionable unto it. God
that <hi>willeth not the death of a ſinner,</hi> would not for
any inferiour end will the death of his Sonne,
whom he loved more then all creatures beſides.
It muſt needs be ſome great matter for which
God ſhould contrive the death of his Sonne, ſo
holy, ſo innocent, and ſeparate from ſinners:
neither could it be any other matter, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
that which he moſt hated; and that was,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:155276:28"/>
Sin: and to ſet forth that which he moſt deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in, and that was, Mercy. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26.
And accordingly Chriſt demeaned himſelfe in
it, not at all looking at the Jews, or their malice,
but at his Fathers command and intent in it. And
therefore when he was to ariſe to goe unto that
place where he ſhould be taken, <hi>As the Father
gave me commandement,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ſo doe I: Ariſe;
let us goe hence, Iohn</hi> 14. 31. And when <hi>Iudas</hi> went
out at Chriſts owne provocation of him, <hi>What
thou doeſt, doe quickly,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the Sonne of man
goeth as it was determined:</hi> he lookt to his Fathers
purpoſe in it. When he went out to be taken, it
is ſaid, <hi>Iohn 18. 4. Ieſus knowing all things that
ſhould befall him, went forth.</hi> And when he was in
his Agony in the Garden, whom doth he deale
with, but his Father? <hi>Father,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>if it be
poſsible, let this cup paſſe:</hi> and God made his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſo great neceſſity, that it was even impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that that cup ſhould paſſe. Indeed, had
Chriſt ſtood in his owne ſtead, it had been an
eaſie requeſt, and juſtice to grant it; yea, ſo he
tells <hi>Peter,</hi> that he could command millions of
Angels to his reſcue; but he meerly ſubmits unto
his Father, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done,</hi> (ſayes
he) for God had laid upon him the iniquities of
us all, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.</p>
                     <p>Let our faith therefore look mainly to this
deſigne and plot of God and of Chriſt in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
to ſatisfie for our ſins, and to juſtifie us
ſinners. When we conſider him as borne fleſh
and bloud, and laid in a manger, think we withall,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:155276:29"/>
that his meaning was to condemne <hi>ſin in our fleſh,
Rom.</hi> 8. 4. So when we read of him fulfilling all, or
any part of righteouſnes, take we his mind in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
to be, that the <hi>Law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> as it
follows there, who were then repreſented in him;
and ſo the fulfilling of it is accounted ours. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
we him in his life time, as <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt
did, even as <hi>the Lamb of God, bearing and taking away
the ſins of the world:</hi> and when upon the Croſſe,
let our faith behold the iniquities of us all met
in him: [<hi>Surely he hath borne our ſorrowes,] [bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our ſinnes in his body on the tree] and thereby
once offered to beare the ſinnes of many,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Heb. 9. &amp;c.</hi>
This intent of Chriſt in all that he did and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
is that welcome newes, and the very ſpirit
of the Goſpel, which faith preys and ſeiſeth on.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall not inſiſt ſo largely on this firſt Head of
Chriſts dying, as upon thoſe three following, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is the main ſubject of another Diſcourſe,
(which, through Gods grace, I intend to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
though in another method) Onely (for a

how Chriſts ſatisfaction may be oppoſed,

What is there that can be ſaid to aggravate
ſin in the generall, or any mans particular ſins,
that may not be anſwered out of this, <hi>Chriſt
hath dyed?</hi> and ſomething not be conſidered in
it, which the conſcience may oppoſe thereto?
So that what ever evill, which according to the
rules of ſpirituall reaſon, (which the righteous
Law proceedeth by, and containeth as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of its righteouſneſſe in condemning or ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating
ſinne) a mans conſcience may ſuggeſt
to be in ſinne; oppoſitely hereunto, may a mans
faith, according to the like rules of true ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

to have been in Chriſts death, (which the Goſpel
reveales) and ſo may oppoſe the one to the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:155276:30"/>
other, and have as good reaſon to ſhew why
ſinne ſhould not condemne (from CHRISTS
death) as Conſcience can have, that the Law
may condemne.</p>
                     <p>As firſt,<note place="margin">1. Againſt the hainouſneſſe of ſin in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> Is ſinne the tranſgreſſion of the Law?
Chriſt dying, the Law-maker, was ſubjected to
the Law; and will not that make amends? Is
ſin the debaſement of Gods glory, manifeſted in
his Word and Works? Chriſts dying was the
debaſement and emptying of the brightneſſe of
his glory in the higheſt meaſure, being perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifeſted in the fleſh. The one of them is
but as the darkning the ſhine or luſtre of the Sun
upon a wall, but the other is as the obſcuring of
the Sun it ſelfe. Sins higheſt evill lies in offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God; but Chriſts righteouſneſſe is (oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely)
the <hi>righteouſneſſe of God himſelfe; or Iehovah
made our righteouſneſſe:</hi> So that God in <hi>our ſinne</hi>
is conſidered but as the <hi>object againſt whom;</hi> but
God in this <hi>our righteouſneſſe,</hi> is <hi>the ſubject from
whom,</hi> and <hi>in whom</hi> this righteouſneſſe comes,
and is feated: And ſo his God-head anſwerably
gives a higher worth to it, by how much the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
which the ſubject hath to an action of its
owne, that proceeds from it, is nearer then that
which an object hath, againſt which the action
is committed.</p>
                     <p>Or ſecondly,<note place="margin">2. Againſt any aggravation of. particular ſins</note> what peculiar aggravations or

kind of blaſphemy, as making himſelf <hi>equall</hi> with

though to ſhew how great an evill and miſery it
was in it ſelfe, he ſhewed an averſeneſſe to it; yet
as it was his Fathers will for our ſalvation, hee
heartily embraced, and drank off that cup unto
the bottome.</p>

                     <p>As firſt, that ſo great a perſon in the Church
ſhould ſcandalize the Name of God in ſinning:
Why, how great a Perſon was Chriſt? even
equall with God the Father; and yet how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
humbled? even to the death; his offices of
King, Prieſt, and Prophet being debaſed with
him: how great a name had he? as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 4. which
notwithſtanding was diſhonoured more then ever
any mans.</p>
                     <p>Or 2. that thou ſinnedſt at ſuch a time, or in ſuch
a company, which ſometimes ſerve to make a ſin
the more hainous: Conſider how God contrived
to have the ſhame and affliction of his Sons death
aggravated by all theſe circumſtances: It was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:155276:32"/>
of deaths the moſt accurſed; At a time moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne;
In a place moſt infamous; With compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
moſt wretched.</p>
                     <p>Thus might we find out that in Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
and ſatisfaction made, that would fitly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to any thing in our ſins; and ſo thereby we
ſhould be the more relieved. And though the
whole body of his ſufferings doe ſtand and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for the whole bulk of our ſinnings; yet the
conſideration of ſuch particulars will much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the ſatisfying of an humbled and deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſoule, about the particulars of its ſinnings.</p>
                     <p>Therefore (to conclude) get your hearts and
conſciences diſtinctly and particularly ſatisfied
in the all-ſufficiencie of worth and merit which is
in the ſatisfaction that Chriſt hath made. As it is
a fault and defect in humiliation, that men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themſelves with a generall apprehenſion
and notion that they are ſinners, and ſo never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
throughly humbled; ſo is it a defect in their
faith, that they content themſelves with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
and generall conceit, that Chriſt dyed for
ſinners; their hearts not being particularly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
about the tranſcendent all-ſufficiencie of
his death. And thence it is, that in time of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
when their abounding ſinfulneſſe comes
diſtinctly to be diſcovered to them, and charged
upon them, they are then amazed, and their faith
non-pluſt, as not ſeeing that in Chriſt, which
might anſwer to all that ſinfulneſſe: But as God
ſaw that in Chriſts death which ſatisfied him;
ſo you ſhould endeavour by faith to ſee that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:155276:32"/>
worth in it which may ſatisfie God, and then
your faith will ſit down as ſatisfied alſo. If a man
were to diſpute for his life ſome hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
controverſie, wherein are many great and
ſtrong objections to be taken away; he would be
ſure to view, and ſtudy, and ponder all that
might be ſaid on that other part which he were
to hold, in way of anſwer to them, and to get
ſuch a clear and convincing light, as might make
the truth of his Poſition apparent and manifeſt
through thoſe clouds of objections that hang in
the way. Now you will all be thus called one
day, to diſpute for your ſoules, (ſooner or later)
and therefore ſuch skill you ſhould endeavour
to get, in Chriſts righteouſneſſe, how in its ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and perfection it anſwereth to all your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe;
that your hearts may be able to oppoſe
it againſt all that may be ſaid of any particular,
in or about your ſins; that in all the conflicts of
your ſpirits, you may ſee that in it, which could
cleare your whole ſcore; and that if God would
but be pleaſed to impute it to you, you might
ſay, I durſt preſently come to an account with

Chriſts <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> upon which we ſee here,

                        <note place="margin">Some ſpeciall thing in Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for our Juſtification.</note> There muſt therefore be ſome

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:155276:33"/>
for which it ſhould have a [<hi>rather</hi>] put upon

to ſhew wherein this ſhould lie, conſider how the

                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">It ſerveth to a double uſe to ſupport our faith.</note> as an <hi>evidence</hi> to our faith, that God is
fully ſatisfied by Chriſts death: his Reſurrection
may give us full aſſurance of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it had, and hath an <hi>influence</hi> into
our Juſtification it ſelfe; yea and as great an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
as his Death had. In both theſe reſpects it
deſerves a [<hi>rather</hi>] to be put upon it, and <hi>Paul</hi> had
them both in his eye, when he writ theſe words.
So as firſt, if you ask an account of his faith, and
a reaſon of his ſo triumphant aſſurance, hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
his Reſurrection to confirme it, <hi>Chriſt is
riſen.</hi> Or</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if you would have a reaſon of the
thing, how it comes to paſſe, that we who are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
cannot be condemned; <hi>Chriſt is riſen,</hi> ſayes
he: He alledgeth it as a cauſe, that hath ſuch an
influence into Juſtification it ſelfe, as it makes all
ſure about it.</p>
                     <p>1.<note place="margin">1. By way of Evidence.</note> By way of Evidence: Although Chriſts
obedience in his life, and his death paſt, do alone
afford the whole matter of our Juſtification, and
make up the ſumme of that price paid for us, (as
hath been ſhewn) ſo as faith may ſee a fulneſſe
of worth and merit therein, to diſcharge the debt:
yet faith hath a comfortable ſigne and evidence
to confirme it ſelfe in the beliefe of this, from
Chriſts <hi>Reſurrection</hi> after his death: It may fully
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:155276:34"/>
ſatisfie our faith,<note place="margin">Faith hath a viſible ſigne of it, that God is ſatisfied.</note> that God himſelfe is ſatisfied,
and that he reckons the debt as paid: So that
our faith may boldly come to God, and call for
the Bond in, as having Chriſts Reſurrection to
ſhew for it, that the Debt is diſcharged. And
hence the Apoſtle cryes <hi>Victoria</hi> over Sin, Hell,
and Death, upon occaſion of (and as the <hi>Coronis</hi>
and concluſion of that) his large Diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Chriſts Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55, 56, 57.
<hi>O death, where is thy ſting?</hi> that is, Sinne, and the
power of it: for ſo it followes, <hi>The ſting of death
is ſinne:</hi> and <hi>O grave, where is thy victory? Thanks
be to God who hath given us victory, through Ieſus
Chriſt our Lord:</hi> namely, as <hi>riſen</hi> againe; for of
his Reſurrection, and of that chiefly, had he ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
throughout that Chapter.</p>
                     <p>2.<note place="margin">2. By way of Influence.</note> But ſurely this is not all, that it ſhould onely
argue our Juſtification by way of Evidence:
This alone would not have deſerved ſuch a [<hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>]
to be put upon it, if Chriſts Reſurrection
had not had ſome farther reall cauſall influence
into Juſtification it ſelfe, and been more then
ſimply an evidence of it to our apprehenſions.
Therefore ſecondly, in Juſtification, although the
<hi>materiale,</hi> or matter of it, be wholly the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and death of Chriſt;<note place="margin">Though the matter of our Juſtification be the price of Chriſts death, yet the act of pronouncing us righteous, depends on the Reſurrection.</note> yet the act of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
us righteous by that his obedience,
(which is the <hi>formale</hi> of Juſtification) doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon Chriſts Reſurrection. Ordinarily
there hath been no more expreſſed concerning
this dependance, then that the Reſurrection of
Chriſt juſtifies by working actuall faith, to lay
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:155276:34"/>
hold upon what Chriſt hath done in his life and
death, which is called the <hi>applying</hi> of it, (of which
more anon.) But that ſpeech of <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 17.
ſeems to import more, <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen again,
[ye are yet in your ſins, [and your faith is in vaine:</hi>]
That is, although you could ſuppoſe faith to be
wrought in you upon the merit of Chriſts dying,
yet it would be <hi>in vain,</hi> if Chriſt were not <hi>riſen</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
for your title to Juſtification it ſelf would be
void: <hi>You were yet in your ſins.</hi> Which is ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his Reſurrection was it, wherby ſins (though
ſatisfied for in his death) were taken off, and they
acquited from them: Which I take to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
alſo of that <hi>Rom. 4. ult. He was delivered for
our ſins, [and roſe again for our Iuſtification.</hi>] When
the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>for our ſins he was delivered,</hi> he
means, his laying down <hi>that</hi> which was the price
for them, a ſatisfaction for them, which his death
was: And in that ſenſe, <hi>He dyed for our ſins;</hi> that is,
his death ſtands in ſtead of our death, and ſo ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
for ſin. But yet ſtill <hi>that</hi> upon which the act of
Gods juſtifying us, &amp; his diſcharge given us from
our ſins, and whereby he reckoneth us juſtified,
that depends upon his Reſurrection. <hi>He roſe again
for our juſtification.</hi> Note that Juſtification there
imports the act of <hi>imputation,</hi> and reckoning us
juſt, which he had ſpoken of in the verſes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
fore-going, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23, 24.</p>
                     <p>In a word, to the full diſcharge of a Debt, and
freeing the Debtour, two things are requiſite:
1. The payment of the debt: 2. The tearing or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
the Bond, or receiving an Acquitance for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:155276:35"/>
the freeing of the Debtor. Now the Payment was
wrought by Chriſts death, and the Acquitance
to free from the debt, was at, and by his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>

                     <p>NOw the better to explicate both theſe, you

all that he did [<hi>for us</hi>] (as the phraſe is here, and

double relation for us unto God.</p>
                     <p>1. Of a <hi>Surety,</hi> bound to pay the debt for us,
and to ſave our ſoules.</p>
                     <p>2. Of a <hi>Common perſon,</hi> or as an Attorney at Law,
in our ſtead. And both theſe as they have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
and differing conſideration in themſelves,
ſo thoſe ſeverall conſiderations of them will
conduce to the underſtanding of thoſe two things
fore-mentioned, as wayes and arguments to ſhew
how the Reſurrection of Chriſt may ſupport our
faith, both by way of <hi>evidence</hi> that the debt is
paid, and by way of <hi>influence</hi> that we are thereby
acquited, and cannot be condemned. The notion
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:155276:35"/>
of his being riſen, who is our <hi>Surety,</hi> clears the
firſt, and that of his riſing as a <hi>Common perſon,</hi> il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrates
the other. And I ſhall here a little the
largelyer inſiſt upon the explication of theſe two
relations, becauſe their conſideration will be of
uſe through all the reſt that follows, to illuſtrate
thereby the influence that his Aſcenſion, and
Sitting at Gods right hand, &amp;c. have into our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification;
and ſo I ſhall carry them along
throughout this Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>1.<note place="margin">1. To be a Surety, what.</note> A <hi>Surety</hi> is one that undertakes, and is
bound to doe a thing for another: As, to pay a
debt for him, or to bring him ſafe to ſuch or
ſuch a place, or the like; ſo as when he hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
what he undertook and was bound for,
then the party for whom he undertook is diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
alſo.</p>
                     <p>2.<note place="margin">2. A Common perſon, what.</note> A <hi>Common perſon</hi> with, or for another hee
goes for, is one who repreſents, perſonates, and
acts the part of another, by the allowance and
warrant of the Law: ſo as what he doth, (as ſuch
a common perſon, and in the name of the other)
that other whom he perſonates, is by the Law
reckoned to doe: and in like manner, what is
done to him, (as being in the others ſtead and
roome) is reckoned as done to the other. Thus
by our Law, an Attorney appears for another, &amp;
money received by him, is reckoned as received
by him whom it is due unto. Thus the giving
poſſeſſion of an eſtate, a re-entry made, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
taken of land, &amp;c. if done by, and to a
man who is his lawfull Attorney, it ſtands as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:155276:36"/>
good in Law unto a man, as if in his owne perſon
it had been done. So Embaſſadours for Princes
repreſent their Maſters: what is done to them, is
reckoned as done to the Prince; and what they do
according to their Commiſſion, is all one as if the
Prince, whoſe Perſon they repreſent, had done it
himſelfe. In like manner alſo the marriages of
Princes are tranſacted, &amp; ſolemnized by Proxie,
as a Common perſon repreſenting his Lord, and
in his name, is married to a Princeſſe in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Court; and the Lawes of men authorize it,
and the marriage is as good, as if both Princes
themſelves had been preſent, and had performed
all the Rites of it.<note place="margin">The difference betweene theſe two.</note> And thus to be a <hi>Common perſon,</hi>
is more then ſimply to be a <hi>Surety</hi> for another; it is
a farther thing: and therefore theſe two relations
are to be diſtinctly conſidered, though they ſeem
to be ſomewhat of a like nature. Thus an Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is a different thing from a Surety: A Surety
undertakes to pay a debt for another, or the like;
but a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon perſon ſerves to perform any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
act, which by the Law is reckoned, and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
imputed to the other, and is to ſtand as the
others act, &amp; is as valid, as is he had done it: So as
the good and benefit which is the conſequent of
ſuch an act, ſhall accrew to him whom he perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
and for whom he ſtood as a Common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<hi>Adam</hi> was not a <hi>Surety</hi> for all Man-kind,<note place="margin">Adam a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon, but not a Surety.</note> he
undertook not for them, in the ſenſe fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
but he was a <hi>Common perſon</hi> repreſenting all
Man-kind; So as what he ſhould do, was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
as if they had done it. Now the better to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:155276:36"/>
expreſſe and make ſure our Juſtification in and by
Chriſt, according to all ſorts of Laws, (the equity
of all which God uſually draws up into his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations)
God did ordain Chriſt both to be a <hi>Surety</hi>
for us,<note place="margin">Chriſt ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be both, and the reaſon why.</note> and alſo a <hi>Common perſon</hi> repreſenting us,
and in our ſtead. That as Chriſt tooke all other
relations for us, as of an <hi>Husband, Head, Father,
Brother, King, Prieſt, Captain,</hi> &amp;c. that ſo the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his love might be ſet forth to us, in that
what is defective in any one of theſe relations, is
ſupplyed and expreſſed by the other: Even thus
did God ordaine Chriſt to take and ſuſtaine both
theſe relations, of a <hi>Surety</hi> and a <hi>Common Perſon,</hi> in
all he did for us, thereby to make our juſtification
by him the more full and legall; and <hi>juſtifie</hi> (as I
may ſo ſpeake) our <hi>Juſtification</hi> it ſelfe or his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of us, by all ſorts of <hi>legall</hi> conſiderations
what ever, that hold commonly among men in
like caſe: and that which the <hi>one</hi> of theſe relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or conſiderations might not reach to make
good, the <hi>other</hi> might ſupply; what fel ſhort in the

both to pay the debt, by undergoing death in

<hi>Heire</hi> to execute his Will and Teſtament: He
became a Surety of the whole Covenant, and
every condition in it, take it in the largeſt ſenſe;
and this of all, both on Gods part, and on ours.
For us he undertook to God to work all our
works, and undergoe all our puniſhments;
to pay our debts for us, and to work in us all
that God required ſhould be done by us, in the
Covenant of Grace. And thus to be a Surety, is
much more then ſimply to be an Interceſſour, or
Mediatour, (as <hi>Pareus</hi> well obſerves.) God did
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:155276:38"/>
(as it were) ſay to Chriſt, What they owe me,
I require it all at your hands; and Chriſt aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and from everlaſting ſtruck hands with God,
to doe all for us that God could require, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
it under the penalty that lay upon us to
have undergone. Yea, Chriſt became ſuch a

men.<note place="margin">A ſtrange dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſts Suretiſhip, and that of men for others on earth</note> On earth, Sureties are wont to enter into one

Creditour may ſeize on which of the two he
will, whether on the Debtour, or on the Surety,
and ſo (as uſually) on the Debtor firſt, for him we
call the Principal; but in this covenant, God would
have Chriſts ſingle Bond: and hence Chriſt is not
onely called the Surety of the Covenant for us,
but <hi>The Covenant,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">God makes the Covenant of Grace princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally with Chriſt for us.</note>

God making the Covenant of Grace primarily
with him, and with him as for us, thereby his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle

might be ſure of ſatisfaction: therefore he laid

never be able to ſatisfie me; but you are a <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and ſubſtantiall perſon, <hi>able</hi> to pay me, and I
will look for my debt of you. And to confirme
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:155276:38"/>
this, (then which nothing can give ſtronger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,
or more advanceth Gods free grace)
when God went about the reconciling the world
in and by Chriſt, and dealt with Chriſt about it;
the manner of it is expreſſed to have been, that
God took off our ſins from us, and diſcharged
us, (as it were) meaning never to call us to an
account for them, unleſſe Chriſt ſhould not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
him, and laid them all on Chriſt, ſo as he
would require an account of them all from him
firſt, and let him look to it; and this he did to
make the Covenant ſure. Thus 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. it is
ſaid, (the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Gods tranſaction
of this buſineſſe with Chriſt) that <hi>God was in
Chriſt,</hi> namely, from everlaſting, <hi>reconciling the
world</hi> (of Elect Beleevers) <hi>to himſelfe, not imputing
their treſpaſſes to them; and made him ſin who knew
no ſinne.</hi> Obſerve, that as he laid our ſinnes on
Chriſt, ſo withall, he diſcharged us, in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
betweene Chriſt and himſelfe, [<hi>not imputing
their treſpaſſes to them.</hi>] So then, all laid upon
Chriſt, and he was to look to it, or elſe his ſoule
was to have gone for it. This is not the manner
of other Creditours; they uſe to charge the Debt
on both the Surety and the Debtour; but in this
Covenant (of Grace namely) Chriſts ſingle
Bond is entred, he alone is <hi>The Covenant:</hi> ſo as
God will have nought to ſay to us, till Chriſt
failes him. He hath engaged himſelfe firſt to
require ſatisfactions at Chriſts hands, who is our
Surety.</p>
                     <p>Now then 2.<note place="margin">2. How the conſideration of this is a ſtrong evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to faith, of juſtification from Chriſts Reſurrection.</note> for to make uſe of this notion, for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:155276:39"/>
the clearing of the point in hand. It might afford
us matter of unſpeakable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, onely to hear of
<hi>Chriſts</hi> having been arreſted by God for our debt,
&amp; caſt into <hi>priſon,</hi> and his Bond ſued, and an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
or <hi>Iudgement</hi> ſerved on him, as the phraſes
are, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 8. For thereby we ſhould have ſeen,
how God had begun with our Surety, (as minded
to let us alone) and that it lay on him to diſcharge
the debt, who was ſo able to doe it: And thereby
we might alſo ſee, how he was <hi>made ſin for us,</hi> and
therefore we might very well have quieted our
hearts from fearing any arreſts, or for Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
upon us, till we ſhould heare that our Surety
were not ſufficiently able to pay the debt, (as you
have heard he is.) But yet our hearts would ſtil be
inquiſitive (for all that) to hear whether <hi>indeed</hi> he
hath perfectly ſatisfied God or no; and would be
extreamly ſolicitous, to know whether he hath
ſatisfactorily performed what he undertook; and
how he got cleare of that engagement, and of
<hi>being made ſinne for us.</hi> And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
comforts Beleevers with this, that Chriſt
ſhall <hi>the next time appeare without ſin.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 9. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>Vnto them
that look for him he ſhall appeare the ſecond time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſinne,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">It declaring unto faith, that Chriſt that was in this death nale ſin for us, hath now diſcharged all, and is without ſin.</note> 
                        <hi>unto ſalvation.</hi> One would think it no
great matter of comfort to us, to hear that Chriſt
ſhould appeare without ſinne; for who would
imagine that it could be otherwiſe with <hi>The holy
One, The Lord of Glory?</hi> there is no wonder in that:
Ay, but (ſayes the Apoſtle) your very ſalvation
is intereſted in this; as neerly as is poſſible: It is
well for you that Chriſt is now <hi>without ſinne;</hi> for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:155276:39"/>
he having as your Surety undertooke to ſatisfie
for ſinne, and having accordingly beene <hi>once made
ſinne,</hi> when on earth, and arreſted for it by God
at his death; in that now he is got cleare of that
engagement, (which could be no way, but by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
which he undertooke) this doth plainly
evince it, and aſcertain you, that you ſhall never be
condemned for it: for by the Law, if the Surety
hath diſcharged the debt, the Debtour is then free.
And therefore no news would or could be more
welcome to ſinners,<note place="margin">And ſo that God will never come upon the ſinner.</note> then to have a certaine and
infallible evidence given, that their <hi>Surety</hi> were
well come off, and had <hi>quitted all,</hi> to ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Now then to evidence this, ſerveth his <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
Chriſt is riſen:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How ſtrong an evidence Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is, that the debt is paid, and God ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> Nothing ſo ſure. Therefore
certainly the debt is diſcharged, and he hath paid
it to the full, and ſo is now without our ſinne, and
fully got cleare of it. For God having once arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
Chriſt, and caſt him into priſon, and begun a
tryall againſt him, and had him <hi>to judgement,</hi> he
could not come forth, till he had paid the very ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
farthing. And there is the greateſt reaſon for
it, to aſcertaine us that can be: For he was under
thoſe bonds and bolts, which if it had <hi>been poſsible</hi>
would have <hi>detained</hi> him in the grave, as <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 24.
<hi>The ſtrength of</hi> ſin, and Gods wrath, and the curſe
againſt ſin, (<hi>Thou ſhalt die the death</hi>) did as <hi>cords hold</hi>
him, (as the Pſalmiſts phraſe is.) Other debtours
may poſſibly breake their priſons; but Chriſt
could not have broke through this, for the wrath
of the All-powerfull God, was this priſon;
from which there was no eſcaping, no baile: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would be taken to let him goe out, but full
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:155276:40"/>
ſatisfaction. And therefore to hear that Chriſt is
<hi>riſen,</hi> &amp; ſo is come out of priſon, is an evidence that
God is ſatisfied, and that Chriſt is diſcharged by
God himſelf; and ſo is now <hi>without ſin,</hi> he walking
abroad again at liberty: And therefore the Apoſtle
proclaimes a mighty <hi>victory</hi> obtained by Chriſts
Reſurrection, over <hi>Death,</hi> the <hi>Grave,</hi> the ſtrength of
<hi>ſinne,</hi> the <hi>Law, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 55, 56. and cryes out, <hi>Thanks

it in the generall,<note place="margin">That Chriſt was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon, proved.</note> that inſtance of <hi>Adam</hi> ſerves
moſt fitly, and is indeed made uſe of in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,

juſt Law, what he did was reckoned to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
whom he repreſented. And what was by
that Law threatned, or done to him for what he
did, is threatned againſt his poſterity alſo. Now
this man was herein a lively type of our Lord
Chriſt,<note place="margin">the Type of Chriſt herein.</note> as you have it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. [<hi>Who was the
type of him who was to come.</hi>] Unto which purpoſe,
the titles which the Apoſtle gives theſe two,
Chriſt and <hi>Adam, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 47. are exceeding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable;
he calls <hi>Adam, The firſt man;</hi> and Chriſt
our Lord, <hi>The ſecond man:</hi> and both for that very
purpoſe and reſpect which we have in hand: For,
firſt, he ſpeaks of them, as if there had never been
any more men in the world, nor were ever to
be for time to come, except theſe two: and why?
but becauſe theſe two betweene them, had all
the reſt of the ſons of men hanging at their gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
becauſe they were both Common perſons,
that had the reſt in like (though oppoſite) conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
included, and involved in them. <hi>Adam</hi>
had all the ſons of <hi>Men</hi> borne into this world, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded

men, ver.</hi> 48. in a conformity to him <hi>the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

names are written in heaven,</hi> and therefore in the

in him. You ſee how he ſummes up the
number of all men in two, and reckons but two
men in all; theſe two, in Gods account, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for all the reſt. And farther obſerve, that
becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was in this his <hi>being,</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                     <p>Now if you aske,<note place="margin">Particularly: In what things Chriſt was a Common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> wherein Chriſt was a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

For he had no other end to come downe into this

us, acted upon him.</p>
                     <p>Thus firſt,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> in their two ſeverall conditions,
qualifications,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſons, in their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, and ſtates.</note> and ſtates, they both were <hi>Common
perſons:</hi> That is, look what ſtate or condition the
one or the other was made in, is by a juſt Law
to be put upon thoſe whom they repreſented. So
the Apoſtle reaſons from it, <hi>ver.</hi> 48. [<hi>As] is the
earthly man,</hi> (namely, the firſt man, <hi>Adam) [ſuch]
are the earthly:</hi> namely, to be earthly men as well
as he; becauſe he who was a Common perſon
repreſenting them, was in his condition but an
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:155276:41"/>
                        <hi>earthly man:</hi> And oppoſitely, by the ſame Law,
it follows, [<hi>As] is the heavenly man,</hi> (namely, the
ſecond man, Chriſt) [<hi>ſuch] are and muſt be the
heavenly,</hi> who pertaine to him, becauſe he alſo is
a Common perſon, ordained to perſonate them:
and <hi>Adam,</hi> who came after him, was therein but
his Type.</p>
                     <p>And as thus in this place to the <hi>Corinths</hi> the
Apoſtle argues Chriſt to be a Common perſon,
in reſpect of his condition and ſtate, by an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of parallels taken from his Type, <hi>Adam;</hi>
So ſecondly, in that 5. to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> he argues
Chriſt to have been a Common perſon,<note place="margin">2. Chriſt a Common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in reſpect of what he did, or what he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                        </note> in his
actions which he did on earth; and this alſo from
the ſimilitude of <hi>Adam,</hi> whom <hi>ver.</hi> 14. he therein

Hence, both what he did, they are ſaid to
doe in him; and what condemnation or death
was deſerved by his ſin, fell upon them all, by
this Law of his being a publique perſon for
them.</p>
                     <p>1. For what he did: He ſinned,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Adam</hi> a Common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in what he did.</note> you know;

may render that ſentence (and the Originall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:155276:42"/>
bears it, and it is alſo varied in the Margent) thus,
[<hi>In whom] all have ſinned;</hi> namely, in <hi>Adam,</hi> as in

The curſe reacheth us too; <hi>Death paſſed upon all

was in all this,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> a Common perſon repreſenting
us, and ſo in our ſtead; and ſo all this concerns <hi>us,</hi>
as truely and as neerly as it did <hi>him.</hi> I ſay by a

of this Rule, pronounceth a <hi>Statute</hi> out againſt
<hi>all men,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>die, Heb. 9. 27. Statutum

                     <p>Juſt thus the matter ſtands in the point of our<note place="margin">§. 2.</note>
juſtification and ſalvation,<note place="margin">Anſwerably Chriſt ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Common perſon, both in what he did, or was done to him.</note> betweene Chriſt and
Elect Beleevers; for <hi>Adam</hi> was herein his Type.
Chriſt was conſidered and appointed of God as a
Common perſon, both in <hi>what he did,</hi> and in
what was <hi>done to him:</hi> So as by the ſame Law,
what he did for us, is reckoned or imputed to us,
as if we our ſelves had done it; and what was
<hi>done</hi> to him, tending to our <hi>juſtification</hi> and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is reckoned as done to us. Thus when Chriſt
<hi>dyed,</hi> he dyed as a Common perſon, and God
reckoneth that we dyed alſo. When Chriſt <hi>aroſe,</hi>
he roſe as our Head, and as a Common perſon,
and ſo then God accounts that we roſe alſo with
him. And by vertue of that <hi>communion</hi> which
we had with him in all thoſe actions of his, it is,
that now when we are <hi>born againe,</hi> we do all <hi>riſe</hi>
both from the guilt of ſin, and from the power
of it; even as by vertue of the like communion
we had with (or being one in) <hi>Adam,</hi> we come to
be made ſinfull, when we begin firſt to exiſt as
men, and to be firſt borne.</p>
                     <p>Thus in his death he was conſidered as a

                        </note> and God reckoned us dying

in reſpect of the work of it, as wrought in them;

may <gap reason="foreign">

which Concluſion cannot be made, unleſſe this

and you were included in him. And indeed, this
Conſideration the Apoſtle ſuggeſts unto our
faith, both as the greateſt encouragement againſt
imperfect mortification begun; that yet we may
comfort our ſelves by faith, as reckoning our
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:155276:43"/>
ſelves wholly dead in Chriſts death, and ſo may
aſſure our ſelves, we ſhall one day be perfectly

dead to ſin in Chriſt, when he dyed; and ſo ſhould
think it the greateſt abſurdity in the world to ſin,
even the leaſt ſinne, we being dead long ſince,
and that wholly, when Chriſt our Head dyed:
<hi>And how ſhall we that are dead to ſinne, live any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
therein?</hi> And <hi>ver. 7. He that is dead, is free
from ſinne;</hi> and how then ſhall we doe the leaſt
ſervice to it? Now all this he puts upon Chriſts
dying, and our dying then with him: <hi>ver.</hi> 6.
[<hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him,</hi>
(even when he was crucified) <hi>that it might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed</hi>]
one day in us, fully and perfectly: <hi>Chriſts
Body</hi> repreſenting therein as a publique perſon,
the Elect, and their <hi>body of ſin</hi> conjunct with
them. So as thus by faith they are to reaſon
themſelves wholly dead to ſin in Chriſt, and to
uſe it as a reaſon and motive to ſtir up themſelves
not to yeeld to the leaſt ſin. I uſe this expreſſion
of being <hi>wholly</hi> dead, becauſe if he had ſpoken
meerly of that <hi>imperfect</hi> mortification begun in
us, the argument would not have been a <hi>perfect</hi>
motive againſt the leaſt ſinnes. [<hi>We who are
dead, how ſhall we live in ſinne,</hi>] or yeeld unto
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:155276:44"/>
the leaſt ſinne? For it might be ſaid, Alas, we are
but imperfectly dead; and from an imperfect
death could but an imperfect argument have
been drawn. But the Scripture elſewhere tels us,
that <hi>Chriſt by his death hath [perfected] for ever all
that are ſanctified:</hi> ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. So as in his death
they may reckon themſelves perfectly dead by
faith, and perfectly ſanctified, though yet the
work be not actually and fully perfected.</p>
                     <p>And all this communion with Chriſt as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
perſon, repreſenting them in his death, he
there inſtructs them to be repreſented and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up to them by their Baptiſme; ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4.
How, I ſhall ſhew afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Now as this place holds forth Chriſt as a
<hi>Common perſon</hi> in his <hi>Death</hi> repreſenting us;<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> ſo
other places hold forth the like of his <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, how Chriſt was a Common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and therein repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting us.</note>
In the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20. the Apoſtle argues, that
Elect Beleevers muſt and ſhall riſe, becauſe <hi>Now
Chriſt is riſen from the dead, and is become the firſt-fruits
of them that ſleep.</hi> See the force of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
founded upon this notion and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that Chriſt was a Common perſon repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
all the reſt; and this ſtrongly preſented in
that expreſſion of his being <hi>the firſt-fruits,</hi> in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
to the Rite in the Leviticall Law. All the
ſheaves in a field being unholy of themſelves,
there was ſome one ſheafe in the name and room
of all the reſt, (which was called the <hi>firſt-fruit</hi>)
which was lift up, and waved before the Lord;
and ſo all the ſheaves abroad in the field, by that
act done to this one ſheafe, were conſecrated unto
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:155276:44"/>
God, (<hi>Levi. 23. 10. &amp;c.</hi>) by vertue of that law. The
meaning of which Rite, the Apoſtle expounding;
alledgeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. [<hi>If the firſt-fruits be holy, all
the lump is holy alſo,</hi>] Thus when we were all <hi>dead,</hi>
Chriſt as the <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> riſeth, and this in our
name and ſtead, and ſo we all riſe with him and
in him. And although the Saints departed are not,
it their owne perſons, as yet riſen, (as wee all
who are now alive, are not in our own perſons yet
dead) yet in the meane time, because thus they
are riſen in Chriſt, as their Firſt-fruits; hence, in the
very words following, hee faith, they are but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep,
[<hi>He is become the firſt-fruits of them that ſleep,</hi>]
becauſe they remaine alive in Chriſt their Head,
and ſhall riſe one day: becauſe [<hi>in him</hi>] they vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
are already <hi>riſen;</hi> and this in Gods account
in as true and juſt a ſenſe, as we (though perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alive) are yet all reckoned <hi>dead in Adam,</hi> becauſe
in as a Common perſon had the ſentence of death
pronounced on him, by vertue of which we muſt
dye; and this by the force of the ſame Law, even
of that which wee have inclucated of being a
<hi>Common perſon,</hi> repreſenting us. And indeed, ſo it
followes, (which argues this to be the Apoſtles
meaning) <hi>ver. 21. For as in Adam all die, even ſo in
Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> His argument lies thus:
<hi>Adam</hi> was the firſt-fruits of them that <hi>dyed; Chriſt,</hi>
of them that <hi>riſe.</hi> Hence therefore we are elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
ſaid (though in reſpect to another life) to be
<hi>riſe with Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 5, 6. &amp; (which is yet more)
<hi>to ſit together with him in heaven:</hi> becauſe he as a
Common perſon repreſenting us, ſits there in

                     <p>NOw then to come to the other branch of the

to us as a Common Perſon <hi>repreſenting us in his

And this is the point I drive at; and for the
clearing of which that large and general diſcourſe
by way of digreſſion in the former Chapter was
but to make way for.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall abſolve and diſpatch this Branch, by
ſhewing two things:</p>
                     <p>1. That Chriſt himſelfe was <hi>juſtified,</hi> and that
at his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. That he was <hi>juſtified</hi> then as a <hi>Common perſon,</hi>
repreſenting us therein, as well as that he roſe as a
Common perſon; and ſo that <hi>we</hi> were then <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
in him and with him; and by this meanes it is
that by that <hi>Act</hi> then done to him, our Juſtification
is made irrepealable for ever.</p>
                     <p>For the explicating of the firſt:<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> As Chriſt was
in his death made ſinne for us,<note place="margin">1. That Chriſt himſelfe was <hi>juſtified</hi> at his Reſurrection.</note> and ſo ſuſtained
our perſons in his ſatisfying for ſin by his death,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:155276:45"/>
(which is the matter of our righteouſneſſe) ſo
in and upon his Reſurrection he was juſtified and
acquited from our ſins by God,<note place="margin">Made forth by three things laid together.</note> as having now
fully in his Death ſatisfied for them, which I make
forthby theſe three things put together:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in reaſon,<note place="margin">1. There muſt have been ſome Act paſſe from God, when Chriſt was acquited and juſtified from our ſins by God.</note> if that Chriſt were made
ſinne for us, and ſatisfied for it, there muſt
then ſome <hi>Act</hi> paſſe, whereby Chriſt ſhould
be pronounced acquit of our ſinnes, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cleare of them, and ſo be himſelfe formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
juſtified, in reſpect of thoſe ſins, for which
he undertook to ſatisfie. For according to the
courſe of all Proceedings, if a charge of guilt be
formally laid, there muſt be as formall an Act of
acquiting, and of giving a <hi>Quietus eſt:</hi> There is
no man, but for his owne diſcharge and ſecurity
would deſire it. Nor is there any wiſe man that
payes a debt for which he is legally ſued, that wil
not have upon the payment of it, as legall an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitance.
<hi>Paul,</hi> when he was caſt into priſon by
a publique Act of Authority, he ſtood upon it
to have a publique Act of Releaſe from the ſame
Magiſtrates, and would not goe forth of priſon
privily, though themſelves ſent to him ſo to goe
out, <hi>Acts</hi> 36. 37. Now God himſelfe did <hi>lay the
iniquities of us all</hi> upon Chriſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 6. and <hi>had
him to priſon, and to Iudgement</hi> for them, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.
There muſt therefore ſome Act paſſe from God,
legally to take them off from him, and declaring
him diſcharged, to deliver him from Priſon and
Judgement.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>De facto</hi> it is evident,<note place="margin">That there was ſuch an Act paſſed.</note> that there was ſome
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:155276:46"/>
ſuch <hi>Act</hi> paſſed from God; for as we read, that
Chriſt vvhile he lived, and alſo in his Death, was
<hi>made ſin, and did beare the ſin of many,</hi> as the phraſe
is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. So we read in the very next words,
that <hi>he ſhall appeare the ſecond time [without ſinne,]</hi>
which muſt needs be ſpoken in a direct oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his <hi>having born</hi> our ſins, and appearing then
with all our ſins laid to his charge. He appeared
charged with them then, but now he ſhall <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare</hi>
as apparently and as manifeſtly to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thoſe ſins, (for of our ſins it muſt needs be
meant) and ſo to be diſcharged of them as fully,
as ever he appeared charged with them: For
it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall [appeare] without ſin;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the judgements of all it ſhall be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
that <hi>that</hi> God that once charged him with
them, hath now fully diſcharged him of them.
The Apoſtle ſpeaks of it as of a great alteration
made in this reſpect betweene Chriſt as he was
whilſt on earth, and Chriſt as he is to appeare the
ſecond time, and is now in heaven. And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
or diſcharge muſt neceſſarily be made
by God; for he is the Creditour vvho followed
the Suit, and therefore he alone can give the
Acquitance.</p>
                     <p>Now ſecondly,<note place="margin">2. There muſt be ſome ſeaſon of <hi>time,</hi> when this diſcharge from our ſins was firſt made unto Chriſt.</note> from hence it will follow,
that there muſt be ſome <hi>time</hi> when this alteration
was firſt made, and diſcharge given; when Chriſt
from being ſin, as he was made, ſhould become
without <hi>ſinne,</hi> through Gods acquiting of him;
and this, ſay I, was at his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> It is not
deferred as then to be firſt done, when he is to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:155276:46"/>
appeare the ſecond time, though then it <hi>appeares</hi>
indeed, but it is really done before; for hee
comes then to judge others for ſinne. Now in
reaſon, when ſhould this Acquitance or Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
from our ſins be firſt given to Chriſt, and
legally pronounced on him, but when he had
paid the laſt farthing of the debt, and made his
ſatisfaction compleat? which was then done,
when he began to riſe: for his lying in the grave
was a part of his Humiliation, and ſo of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
as generally Orthodoxe Divines hold.
Now therefore when he began to riſe, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Humiliation; and that was the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Exaltation. His Acquitance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bears Date from thence, even from that
very houre.</p>
                     <p>Hence thirdly,<note place="margin">3. That this muſt needs be, and was firſt made to him at his <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                        </note> we read, as that Chriſt was
<hi>condemned,</hi> ſo that he was <hi>juſtified.</hi> Thus 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.
God is ſaid to be <hi>manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> and then
that this God-man was <hi>juſtified in the ſpirit:</hi> That
is, whereas God was manifeſt or appeared <hi>in
fleſh to condemne ſinne in the fleſh,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. that
ſame God-man was alſo <hi>juſtified in the ſpirit</hi> from
all thoſe ſins, and ſo <hi>received up to glory,</hi> as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
there. And not to goe far, the very words
of this my Text, <hi>[It is God that juſtifies]</hi> are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of <hi>Eſay</hi> 50. 8, 9. and as there, they are
firſt ſpoken by Chriſt of himſelfe, then, when he
gave <hi>his back to the ſmiters, in his death,</hi> (as in the
verſes before) and vvas put to death as a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi>
man, he comforts himſelfe vvith this,
<hi>[He is neere that juſtifies me, who ſhall condemne?]</hi>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:155276:47"/>
And when was that done, or to be done, but at
his Reſurrection? So the phraſe in <hi>Timothy</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
if you compare it with another in <hi>Peter,</hi>
1 <hi>Pet. 3. 18. Being put to death in the fleſh, [and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in</hi> (or by) <hi>the ſpirit.] Paul,</hi> he ſayes, [<hi>Iuſtified in
the ſpirit;] Peter,</hi> he ſayes, [<hi>Quickned in the ſpirit:]</hi>
both meane one and the ſame thing. By <hi>[Spirit]</hi>
is meant the <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>God-head,</hi> and <hi>Divine
nature,</hi> whereby he was at once both raiſed from
the grave, and from under the guilt of ſin toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
He was at once both <hi>quickned,</hi> (or raiſed)
and <hi>juſtified</hi> alſo. And that by <hi>[Spirit]</hi> they mean
his <hi>Divine nature,</hi> the oppoſition in both places
evidently implyes; for it is oppoſed to his <hi>[Fleſh]</hi>
or humane nature. Now becauſe he was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>(or raiſed)</hi> by the power of the God-head,
and at that raiſing him, he was <hi>juſtifyed</hi> alſo by
God, and declared juſtifyed by that Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(as he had been declared condemned by his
death) Hence, to <hi>[be juſtified]</hi> is put for his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;</hi>
for that was his juſtification, or declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all the world, that he was juſtified from
all the ſins laid to his charge. And that other
place I cited out of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> hath the ſame meaning
alſo; for Chriſt there comforts himſelfe againſt
the Jews condemning him, and putting him to
death, with the hopes of Gods juſtifying of
him, when he ſhould have gone through that
work. And Chriſts meaning there is this, <hi>God
will raiſe me up, and acquit me,</hi> though you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
and kill me. In the other Prophets you
ſhall find Chriſt ſtill comforting himſelf againſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:155276:47"/>
his condemnation at his death, with the thoughts
of his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> which he fore-ſaw as ſhortly to
follow after it; as here in <hi>Eſay</hi> he comforts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with theſe hopes of his <hi>being juſtified</hi> after
their condemnation of him. For inſtance, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16. 9.
<hi>My fleſh ſhall reſt in hope, thou wilt not leave my ſoule
in hell, nor ſuffer thy holy One to ſee corruption.</hi> Which
words (you know) <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> doth twice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
of Chriſts Reſurrection. In like manner
here in <hi>Eſay,</hi> againſt his death and condemnation
he comforts himſelf with the hopes of Gods juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of him at his Reſurrection, <hi>He is neere who
juſtifies me, (and he ſhall help me) who ſhall condemne?</hi>
And further,<note place="margin">His Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction therefore called his <hi>firſt begetting.</hi>
                        </note> to confirm &amp; ſtrengthen this notion,
becauſe his Reſurrection was the firſt moment of
this his juſtification from our ſins, therefore it is,
that God cals it his firſt begetting of Chriſt, <hi>[This
day have I begotten thee]</hi> ſpeaking manifeſtly of his
Reſurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 35. And the reaſon of his ſo
calling it, is, becauſe all the while before he was
covered with ſin, and the <hi>likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh;</hi> But
now having flung it off, he appears like Gods Son
indeed, (as if newly begotten.) And thus alſo there
commeth to be the fuller conformity betweene
Chriſt juſtification &amp; ours: For as our juſtification
is at our firſt being <hi>born again,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">And therein a conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſo was Chriſt alſo
at this his firſt <hi>glorious begetting.</hi> He was under an
<hi>Attainder</hi> before; here was the <hi>Act of Reſtitution</hi> firſt
paſſed. And as at our Converſion (which is to us a
Reſurrection) wee <hi>paſſe from death to life;</hi> (that
is, from an eſtate of death and condemnation, unto
juſtification of life) ſo did Chriſt alſo at his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
(which to him was are begetting) paſſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:155276:48"/>
from an eſtate of death and guilt laid on him, to an
eſtate of Life &amp; Glory, and juſtification from guilt;
and ſo ſhall <hi>appear,</hi> as the word is, <hi>Heb. 9. ult.</hi> (as he
doth now in heaven) <hi>without ſin;</hi> for he became to
be without ſin fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that very moment. Thus I have
ſhewn how Chriſt was juſtified at his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now then in the 2.<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> place,<note place="margin">2. That Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were all juſtified in Chriſt his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, as a Common perſon repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting them.</note> I am to ſhew that this
his juſtification, and pronouncing him without ſin,
thus done at his Reſurrection, was done to him as
the <hi>Firſt-fruits,</hi> and as to a <hi>Common perſon</hi> bearing
our perſons, &amp; ſo, in our names. From whence wil
neceſſarily follow, as the Concluſion of all, That
the perſons of all the elect Beleevers, have beene
juſtified before God in Chriſt, as their Head, at, or
from the time of his Reſurrection; and ſo that Act
of Juſtification to have beene ſo firmly paſt, as it
cannot be revoked for ever.</p>
                     <p>Now this is proved,<note place="margin">Proved 1. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

(which I ſhewed at large in the former
<hi>Chap.</hi> upon the ſame ground he is to be ſo lookt at

at his Reſurrection, even as the <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> alſo of them

in his Reſurrection; we muſt alſo be ſaid to be <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified

And indeed,<note place="margin">In all things which God doth unto us Chriſt is the firſt-fruits, and God doth them firſt upon him.</note> (to enlarge this a little,) as there is
the ſame reaſon &amp; ground for the one that there is
for the other, (he being a publike perſon in both)

may be ſaid to have beene done <hi>in us,</hi> or <hi>to

ever God meant to doe for us, and in us, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
priviledge or benefit he meant to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

way) beſtowed the like on him as a Common
perſon, that ſo it might be by a ſolemne formall
Act ratified, and be made ſure to be done to us
in our perſons in due time, having firſt been done
to him repreſenting our perſons; and that by this
courſe taken, it might (when done to us) be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by vertue of what was firſt done to him.
Thus God meaning to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> us,<note place="margin">Thus in San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification Chriſt firſt ſanctified, then we in him.</note> he ſanctifies

to be by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16.) that all thoſe <hi>bleſſings
might be ſure to all the ſeed.</hi> For this formall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture
of eſtating us into all bleſſings by ſuch
ſolemne acts done to Chriſt as our Head and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenter
of us, makes what he intends to beſtow,
ſure before-hand, by an irrepealable act and
ſentence, which hath its warrant in all Laws of
men, as I have ſhewne, and ſhall anon again urge.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly,<note place="margin">2. Proved by the equity of that in <hi>Adams</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation we were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> by the equity of the ſame Law
that in <hi>Adam</hi> we were all <hi>condemned, (Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Type of him in this) by the ſame Law (I
ſay) we were all <hi>juſtified</hi> in Chriſt when he was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,
elſe the Type were not therein fulfilled.
Now the ſentence of condemnation was firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon <hi>Adam</hi> alone, yet conſidered as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
perſon for us; therefore alſo this Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Juſtification was then paſſed towards
Chriſt alone, as a publique perſon for us. Yea, in
this his being juſtified,<note place="margin">Chriſt much rather a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon in his being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was in his condemnation.</note> Chriſt muſt much rather
be conſidered as a Common perſon repreſenting
us, then <hi>Adam</hi> was, in his condemnation: For
Chriſt in his owne perſon, as he had no ſinne, ſo
he had no need of any juſtification from ſinne,
nor ſhould ever have been condemned: And
therefore this muſt be onely in a reſpect unto our
ſins imputed to him; and if ſo, then in our ſtead.
And ſo herein, he was more purely to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as a Common perſon for us, then ever
<hi>Adam</hi> was, in his being condemned. For <hi>Adam,</hi>
beſides his ſtanding as a Common perſon for us,
was furthermore condemned in his own perſon;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:155276:50"/>
but Chriſt in being juſtified from ſinne, could
onely be conſidered as ſtanding for others. Thus
<hi>Rom. 5. 18. Therefore as by the offence of one, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
came upon all men to condemnation; even [ſo]</hi>
(or, in like manner) <hi>by the righteouſneſſe of that one
(man Chriſt) the free gift came upon all men</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in Chriſt) <hi>unto juſtification of life.</hi> He parallels
both with a <hi>[So,]</hi> only with this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>Adams</hi> being a Common perſon for us,
(and ſo betweene the ground of our being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in him) and Chriſt his being a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
perſon for us, (and our Acquitance in him)
that the <hi>condemnation came upon all</hi> by a neceſſary,
naturall covenant, (for by ſuch a covenant was
<hi>Adam</hi> appointed a Common perſon for us) but
Chriſt his being appointed thus a Common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for us, it was by a <hi>free gift</hi> of grace; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in like manner by a free gift of grace it is
that the imputation of that which he did, or was
done to him, is reckoned ours. As then <hi>in Adam
all dyed,</hi> when he ſinned, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks)
ſo in <hi>Chriſt</hi> were <hi>all juſtified,</hi> when he was juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
For as in his death Chriſt was a publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for us, and in all that befell him; ſo in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
and in all that was then done to him;
and ſo, in this his being then juſtified. And as
when he dyed, the <hi>Iuſt was put to death</hi> for <hi>the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,</hi>
(as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks) ſo when he roſe and was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,
the Juſt that needed no juſtification was
juſtified for the unjuſt, who elſe had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
and ſo we were then juſtified with
him.</p>

we are juſtified by faith, although juſtified in Chriſt
at his Reſurrection.</head>
                     <p>ANd hereupon is grounded this Triumph of
Faith here, from Chriſts Reſurrection, <hi>Who
ſhall condemne? It is Chriſt that is riſen:</hi> The meaning
whereof is, that was juſtifyed at his Reſurrection,
([<hi>Iuſtified in the Spirit</hi>] and [<hi>Quickned in the Spirit</hi>]
being all one) and <hi>we in him:</hi> Yea, and a [<hi>rather</hi>] is
put upon this, rather then upon his death; for this
act was a ſolemne diſcharge from all ſin and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
it was a legall Acquitance given to
Chriſt for all our ſins, and ſo to us alſo conſidered
as in him. His Death was but the ſatisfaction and
payment; but this is the firſt Act of Abſolution:
Yea, and this is the Originall Act, which is upon
Record between God and Chriſt; and our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and Atonement (when we are juſtified
by faith in Chriſt) is but a Copie fetcht from
this Roll, and Court ſentence then pronounced.</p>
                     <p>And ſuch a way and courſe to ratifie and make
Acts good &amp; legall, (even to have them done by
another repreſenting ones perſon) is common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, (as thoſe inſtances I formerly gave do
ſhew.) An Attorney at Law receives a debt, or an
Acquitance for a debt, paid or given for another
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:155276:51"/>
man, and it is as legall, as if the man himſelfe,
or Creditour had done it, and the Debtour had
received the Acquitance himſelfe. Yea, Acts
of the greateſt and higheſt concernment are
oft-times no otherwiſe tranſacted; as the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of Princes are by Proxy ſolemized, their
Embaſſadours repreſenting their perſons, and
contracting and marrying their wives in their
ſtead, which acts are thereby made as irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and irrepealable, as if themſelves had in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
done them. And ſo if we were juſtified when
Chriſt did riſe and was juſtified, our juſtification
then cannot be reverſed, but ſtands as legall and
warrantable as any act that God or man ever
ratified or confirmed. And <hi>Who then ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Onely,<note place="margin">A Caution.</note> for farther explication ſake, (leſt there
be a miſtake) let me adde this, That it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that we be <hi>juſtifyed</hi> in our owne perſons <hi>by
faith,</hi> (notwithſtanding this former Act thus le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
paſſed) whereby we lay hold upon what
God did thus before for us in Chriſt, to the end
that God upon our beleeving may according to
his owne rules <hi>juſtifie</hi> his juſtifying of us unto all
the world; which untill vve doe beleeve, hee
could not doe: For according to the revealed
Rules of his Word, (vvhich he profeſſeth to
proceed by at the latter day) there is a curſe and
a ſentence of condemnation pronounced againſt
us, under which we ſtand til he ſhall take it off, by
giving us faith; unto which he hath, in the ſame
Word made the promiſe of juſtifying us in our
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:155276:52"/>
own perſons, as before he had done in Chriſt. Yet
ſtill notwithſtanding, ſo, as, although when we
firſt beleeve, then only Juſtification <hi>is actually</hi> and
perſonally applyed to us; yet at Chriſts Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and in his being then juſtified, this act and
ſentence was <hi>virtually</hi> pronounced upon us; and ſo
doth neceſſarily require, and exact at Gods hands,
the beſtowing faith upon us; that ſo by vertue of
this former act paſſed, we come to be actually ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
in our owne conſciences, and before all the
world: And ſo our Juſtification which was but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
wrought, &amp; paſſed upon us in Chriſt, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made void, but ſtands irrepealable; and ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
that our perſonall juſtification by faith doth
alwayes infallibly ſecond and ſucceed it. And (to
illuſtrate it a little) our condemnation in <hi>Adam,</hi>
and this our juſtification in Chriſt, doe in this
hold parallel together, That as in <hi>Adam</hi> we were
all virtually condemned, (<hi>In Adam all dye</hi>) (and
that legally enough too, for thereupon came out
that Statute-Law, <hi>Statutum eſt, It is appointed</hi> that
all ſhould dye) and yet we are not actually in our
owne perſons condemned, till we are borne of
him; nor doe we perſonally dye, untill we lay
downe our fleſh: Even ſo is it in the matter of our
Juſtification; it was done virtually in Chriſt, and
afterwards when we beleeve, is actually paſſed
in and upon our ſelves. Now I call this former
but a <hi>virtuall Iuſtification,</hi> even as by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of condemnation paſſed upon a Malefactor,
he is called a <hi>dead man,</hi> that is, he is ſo virtually
and <hi>in Law,</hi> (as we ſay) though naturally he dye
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:155276:52"/>
not many dayes after, but in that reſpect may
be ſtill alive: ſo by Chriſts being juſtifyed, we
are all virtually, and in Law juſtifyed, through a
ſecret, yet irrepealable Covenant betweene
God and Chriſt, who onely did then <hi>know who
were his.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for a confirmation even of this alſo, That
God accounts all the Elect juſtifyed in his juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt, we ſhall not need to goe any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the words of this Text, if we doe but
diligently compare their ſtanding here, with that
of theirs in that place out of which they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and where we find them firſt recorded and
ſpoken, namely, in that 50. of <hi>Eſay, 7, 8. He is
neere that juſtifies me, who is he that ſhall condemne?</hi>
Now there (as Interpreters agree, and as the
Context ſhews) thoſe words are ſpoken by
Chriſt himſelfe: for <hi>ver.</hi> 5. he ſpeaks of Gods
<hi>boring his eare</hi> to doe his will, (the ſame expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is uſed of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 6.) and farther
ſayes, <hi>I gave my b<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap> to the ſmiters, and my cheeks
to them that pulled off the haire, and I hid not my
face from ſhame and ſpitting:</hi> (all which you may
read in Chriſts ſufferings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 27. and 27. 26.)
And he ſpake before (in <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) of <hi>Gods having
given him the tongue of the learned, to ſpeak a word
in ſeaſon to him that is weary:</hi> (which you may
read done by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28.) Now thoſe
words were ſpoken by Chriſt, to comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
againſt the Jews condemning him, as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that God would juſtifie him; as at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
(you have heard) he did. Now mark it,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:155276:53"/>
thoſe very words which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> brings in Chriſt
ſpeaking as of himſelfe alone, (thoſe very words)
<hi>Paul</hi> here boldly applyes (in the like triumph) to
all the Elect of Chriſt, <hi>Who ſhall condemne? It is
God that juſtifies;</hi> and this, becauſe Chriſt is <hi>dead,</hi> &amp;
<hi>riſen,</hi> and acquited by God. Chriſt ſpake thoſe
words as a publique perſon, in the name of all his
Elect, whom he in his death, and in his juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
repreſented; and for that very reſpect <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpeaks the like words over again, of all Elect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
as being as truly and really intended of
them, when ſpoken by Chriſt, as of himſelf, and
his owne perſon. <hi>He is neere that juſtifies me,</hi> (ſayes
Chriſt) <hi>who ſhall condemne?</hi> (namely) Me, or mine
Elect, whoſe perſons I ſuſtaine. And <hi>Who ſhall
lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> (ſayes <hi>Paul</hi>)
<hi>It is God that juſtifies, who ſhall condemne?</hi> for Chriſt
hath dyed, and been condemned for them, and
Chriſt was juſtifyed from that condemnation, and
they in him. And becauſe the juſtification of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
which Chriſt ſpake of as lookt for from
God, was to be made at his Reſurrection, (as
hath been ſaid) therefore <hi>Paul</hi> here puts a [<hi>rather</hi>]
upon his Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>And farther to eſtabliſh this, as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 10. that in reſpect of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
we were <hi>dead with Chriſt,</hi> even then when
he dyed; ſo in the 2. of <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 13. we are ſaid to
be <hi>riſen with him,</hi> in reſpect of our juſtification,
(which is the thing in hand.) The words are, <hi>And
you being dead in your ſins,</hi> (namely, the guilt of your
ſins) <hi>and the uncircumciſion of your fleſh,</hi> (that is, in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:155276:53"/>
reſpect of the power of corrupt nature) <hi>hath he
quickned together with him, [having forgiven you all
your treſpaſſes.</hi>] See here, the forgiveneſſe of our
ſins, or our juſtification, is called a <hi>quickning,</hi> or a
<hi>raiſing up of us,</hi> (as the 12. <hi>ver.</hi> hath it) <hi>together with
him,</hi> in a conformity and relation to that juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from our ſins, which at his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in our names. His meaning is, he was juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
then, &amp; in our names; and ſo we are now juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
through the vertue of that our communion
with him therein: For if you mark the connexion
of the words with what follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. you will
finde this <hi>forgiving of their treſpaſſes (ver.</hi> 13.)
<hi>through their being quickned together with him,</hi> not
onely to have been done when they beleeved,
and ſo when they had that juſtification perſonally
firſt applyed to them, (of which, it is true, the
words in the 12. <hi>ver.</hi> are to be underſtood) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<hi>then</hi> to have been done, <hi>when he having</hi> (as it
follows in the 14. <hi>ver.) blotted out the hand-writing
of Ordinances</hi> which was againſt us, <hi>nailing it to his
Croſſe,</hi> and <hi>having ſpoiled Principalities and Powers,</hi>
and got the victory, (namely, in his riſing again)
had <hi>made a ſhew of them openly,</hi> (in his aſcending
to heaven) <hi>triumphing over them</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

(as the Margent hath it) (of which words I
ſhall farther ſpeak in the next Head) So as <hi>then
when Chriſt</hi> did this in himſelfe, then were our ſins
forgiven; then were we acquited with him, and
triumphed with him; he doing all this in our

in Baptiſme, wherein alſo you are riſen with him.</hi> The
ominent thing ſignified and repreſented in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme,
is not ſimply the bloud of Chriſt as it wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth

therein of Chriſts Death, Buriall, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
in the Baptized's being firſt buryed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
water, and then riſing out of it; and this not
in a bare <hi>conformity</hi> unto Chriſt, but in a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of a <hi>communion with Chriſt,</hi> in that his
Death and Reſurrection: Therefore it is ſaid, [<hi>We
are buryed with him in Baptiſme:</hi>] and, [<hi>Wherein
you are riſen with him:</hi>] It is not ſimply ſaid, <hi>like
as</hi> he was buryed, and roſe; but [<hi>With him.</hi>] So
as our communion and <hi>one-neſſe with him</hi> in his
Reſurrection, is repreſented to us therein, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:155276:54"/>
not onely our conformity or likeneſſe unto him
therein. And ſo Baptiſme repreſenteth this to us,
that Chriſt having once in himſelfe ſuſtained the
perſons of all the Elect, in his Buriall and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
that now upon the party himſelfe who is
baptized, is perſonally, particularly, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<hi>re-acted</hi> the ſame Part againe, in his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme;
thereby ſhewing what his communion
with Chriſt before was, in what was then done to
Chriſt; that he then was buried with Chriſt, and
roſe with him: and upon that ground, is now in this
outward ſign of Baptiſme, (as in a ſhew or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation)
both buryed, and alſo riſeth againe.</p>
                     <p>And moreover, hence it is, that the <hi>Anſwer

is there alſo attributed unto Chriſts <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as the thing ſignified and repreſented in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme,
and as the <hi>cauſe</hi> of that anſwer of a good

ſave us</hi> (as being the Ordinance that ſeales up
ſalvation) <hi>not the putting away of the filth of the
fleſh,</hi> or the waſhing of the outward man; but
<hi>the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God, [By the
Reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>] To open theſe words:
Our conſciences are that principle in us, which
are the ſeat of the guilt of all the ſinnes of the
whole man; unto whoſe Court they all come
to accuſe us, as unto Gods Deputy: which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is called Good or Evill, as the ſtate of
the man is. If his ſinne remain unpardoned, then
as his eſtate is damnable, ſo his conſcience is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:155276:55"/>
evill: If his ſins bee forgiven, and his perſon ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,
his conſcience is ſaid to bee good: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
having its denomination from the mans
ſtate, even as the Urine is called good or bad, as
the ſtate of the mans body is healthful or unſound,
whoſe Urine it is. Now in Baptiſme, forvive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſins, and juſtification, being ſealed up to a
believers faith &amp; conſcience, under that lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of his Communion with Chriſt
in his Reſurrection: hence this is made the
fruit of Baptiſme, that the good conſcience of a
believer ſealed up in Baptiſme, hath where withall
from thence to anſwer all accuſations of ſin,
that can, or doe at any time come in upon him;
and all this as it is there added, [<hi>By vertue of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of Ieſus Chriſt:</hi>] namely, in this reſpect,
that his Communion with Chriſt in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
hath been repreſented in his Baptiſme
as a ground of his faith, and of that <hi>Anſwer</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all accuſations. So that indeed, the ſame thing
that <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes by way of triumph and defiance
to all accuſations, <hi>Who ſhall condemne? [Chriſt is
riſen</hi>] the very ſame thing <hi>Peter</hi> here mentions,
though not by way of Defiance, yet of a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Anſwer and Apologie, That if ſinnes doe
come to condemne or accuſe, a good conſcience
is ready to ſay, <hi>Chriſt is riſen,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> was then <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified

                     </p>
                     <p>Now to crown this ſecond Pillar of Faith with

this <hi>Coronis</hi> or Concluſion,<note place="margin">Application.</note> by way of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

                        </note> How to
make uſe of Chriſts Reſurrection in point of
non-condemnation. You heard before, out of
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. that in reſpect of Mortification (as the
Apoſtle there reaſoneth) we may be truly ſaid
to have been <hi>perfectly dead</hi> to all <hi>ſinne</hi> in Chriſts
<hi>dying unto ſin once:</hi> and through his repreſenting
us therein as dying unto <hi>ſinne, in</hi> and <hi>with him.</hi>
So as although we be for the preſent but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
mortified in our ſelves, yet when corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ariſe, the Apoſtle bids us help our ſelves
againſt them by faith, [<hi>reaſoning</hi>] our ſelves to
ſtand wholly dead to ſin, when Chriſt dyed; and
ſo to conclude from thence, that we ſhall one
day be fully dead to ſin, becauſe we then did
perfectly dye in Chriſt unto it: which kinde of
<hi>reaſoning</hi> alſo God would have us uſe as a motive
(and of all motives that are in the Goſpell it is
the ſtrongeſt) againſt any corruption when as it
ariſeth; <hi>Shall I that am dead to ſin in Chriſt</hi> (and ſo
am freed from it) <hi>ſhall I live any longer therein?
Ver.</hi> 2. Now as God would have our faith make
this uſe of our Communion with Chriſt in his
death, in point of <hi>ſanctification;</hi> juſt ſo, when
guilt of ſin ariſeth in thy conſcience to accuſe or
threaten condemnation, [<hi>reaſon</hi>] thou thy ſelfe
(as the Apoſtles word is in that other caſe) or
<hi>reckon thy ſelfe</hi> (as our tranſlation hath it) <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
in Chriſt, in his Juſtification, which was done

Death, as an argument to move thee to mortifie
ſin, (bidding thee to reckon thy ſelf dead to ſin
in Chriſt) doe thou deſire him in like manner, to
<hi>reckon thee as juſtified</hi> at Chriſts Reſurrection (for
the ground of both is the ſame) and return that
as an argument to him, to move him <hi>to juſtifie thee.</hi>

will not deny it: And to ſecure thee the more,

begun method, both by ſhewing how <hi>Iuſtification</hi>
it ſelfe <hi>depends</hi> upon this, and the <hi>evidence</hi> thereof
to us: both which the Apoſtle had here in his
eye, and from both which our faith may derive
comfort and aſſurance. And I meane to keep
punctually to the matter of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> onely, as
in the former.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two latter that remain here in the Text,
(<hi>Chriſts ſitting at Gods right hand,</hi> and his <hi>interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for us</hi>) are brought in here by the Apoſtle,
as thoſe which have a <hi>redundant force</hi> and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
in them, for the <hi>non-condemnation</hi> of the
Elect: that although the two former abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſerved to ſecure it; yet theſe two added to the
former, do make the triumph of faith more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and full, and us <hi>more then Conquerours,</hi> as
it after follows. Nor doth this place alone make
mention of Chriſts <hi>ſitting at Gods right hand</hi> (which
I now am firſt to handle) in <hi>this</hi> its <hi>relation,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi>
into our <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> &amp; the aſſurance of faith
about it: but you have it to the ſame end, uſe,
and purpoſe, alleadged by that other great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. from the 18. to the 22. And if the
ſcopes of theſe two Apoſtles in both places be
compared, they are the ſame. <hi>Here</hi> the <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of Chriſt and his <hi>ſitting at Gods right hand</hi> are
brought in as the ground of this bold <hi>challenge</hi> &amp;
<hi>triumph</hi> of faith: and there, is <hi>Peter,</hi> is mentioned
the <hi>Anſwer or Plea of a good conſcience,</hi> in a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
juſtified, which it puts into the Court, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
againſt all condemning guilts: (ſo it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>ver.</hi> 21.) The Apoſtle alleadging <hi>the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:155276:57"/>
of Ieſus</hi> Chriſt as one ground of it, (<hi>the anſwer
of a good conſcience, by the Reſurrection of Ieſus
Chriſt:</hi>) And then further to back and ſtrengthen
this <hi>Plea</hi> or <hi>Anſwer</hi> of a good conſcience, the
Apoſtle puts <hi>his Aſcenſion and ſitting at Gods right
hand</hi> into the Bill, as further grounds confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, ſo it follows, [<hi>who is gone into Heaven, and
is at the right hand of God, Angells, and Authorities,
and Powers, being made ſubject to him:] All which</hi>
the Apoſtle <hi>here</hi> expreſſeth in <hi>one word</hi> (as enough
to carrie it) that <hi>Chriſt is even at Gods right hand.</hi>
The ſoule hath a ſufficient <hi>anſwer</hi> againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
in <hi>Chriſts death,</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> full
enough, though it ſhould ſtop there; yea therein
can faith <hi>triumph,</hi> though it went no further: for
it can ſhew a full ſatisfaction given in his death,
and that accepted by God for us; and Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited,
and we in him: Therefore faith (you ſee)
comes to a [<hi>rather</hi>] there. But then, let it go on, to
conſider Jeſus <hi>ſitting at Gods right hand,</hi> and <hi>making
interceſsion</hi> for us; and then faith will triumph and
inſult over all accuſers, be more then a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
then it comes not to a <hi>rather</hi> onely, (as here)
but to a [<hi>much more] ſhall we be ſaved by his life;</hi> thus
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. And the meaning thereof is, that if his
<hi>death</hi> had power to pay all our debts, and juſtifie
us at firſt; then much more hath his <hi>life</hi> this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
So that his death is but the ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our faith herein, and the loweſt ſtep of this
ladder; but theſe other, are the top &amp; full triumph
of faith therein. And our ſpirits ſhould riſe, as the
Apoſtle herein riſeth: Faith upon theſe wings may
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:155276:58"/>
not onely fly above the Gun-ſhot of all accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and condemners; but even cleane out of their
ſight, and ſo far above all ſuch thoughts &amp; fears,
as it may reach to a <hi>ſecurity that ſins</hi> are forgotten,
and <hi>ſhall be remembred no more.</hi> What <hi>joy</hi> was there
in the Diſciples, when they <hi>ſaw Chriſt riſen? Ioh.</hi>
20. Therefore in the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> it was uſed as
a voice of joy: and to this day the Grecian Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ſ entertain each other, at that time of the
year, with theſe words, <hi>The Lord is riſen:</hi> your
<hi>Surety</hi> is <hi>out</hi> of <hi>Priſon;</hi> fear not. But (as Chriſt ſaid
in another caſe, ſo ſay I) what will you ſay, if you
ſee your <hi>Surety aſcended up to Heaven,</hi> and that, as
<hi>far above Angels and Principalities</hi> (as the Apoſtle
ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.) <hi>as the Heavens are above the Earth?</hi>
will you not in your faiths &amp; hopes proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
aſcend, and climb up alſo; &amp; have thoughts of
pardon, as far exceeding your ordinary thoughts
as the <hi>heavens are above the earth?</hi> Therefore <hi>firſt
view</hi> him, as <hi>aſcending into Heaven,</hi> ere ever hee
comes to be at <hi>Gods right hand,</hi> and ſee what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of triumph that will afford you; for that you
muſt firſt ſuppoſe, ere you can ſee him at Gods
right hand; and ſo is neceſſarily included, thought
not expreſſed here: But that place fore-quoted out
of <hi>Peter</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.) gives us both theſe two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
included in it: 1. His <hi>Aſcenſion, [Who is gone into
Heaven;</hi>] And 2. his <hi>power and authority there, [Is at

to him</hi>] and prompts both theſe, as fit matter to be

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:155276:58"/>
may <hi>here</hi> as well come in <hi>into faiths triumph;</hi> and
that as being intended alſo by the Apoſtle, and
included in this one expreſſion. He ſpeaks with the
leaſt, to ſhew what cauſe faith had to triumph,
for the leaſt expreſſion of it: his purpoſe being
but to give a hint to faith, of that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
contains many things in it, which he would
have us diſtinctly to conſider for our comfort.</p>

Act</hi> when he was to take his riſe, to fly up to
Heaven. He <hi>bleſſed his Diſciples,</hi> and thereby left
a bleſſing upon earth with them, for <hi>all his elect,</hi>
to the end of the World: The true reaſon and
minde of which bleſſing them was, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now to go to execute the eternall office of
his Prieſt-hood in Heaven, (of which God had
ſworn, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of
Melchiſedec,</hi>) As <hi>Melehiſedec</hi> in the Type, <hi>bleſſed
Abraham,</hi> and in him <hi>all</hi> the <hi>faithfull</hi> as <hi>in his loins,</hi>
(therefore the Apoſtle ſaid that <hi>Levi paid tithes
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:155276:59"/>
unto Melchiſedec in Abrahams loines;</hi> therefore
he was bleſſed in his loines) ſo did Chriſt begin
this <hi>new and ſecond part</hi> of <hi>his Prieſt-hood,</hi> with <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi>
the Apoſtles, and in them, all the elect, to
the end of the World. This was the <hi>laſt</hi> thing
that Chriſt did <hi>on earth,</hi> yea this he did, whilſt
aſcending; <hi>he was taken up, whilſt he did it:</hi> So
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 50. 51. And thus ſolemnly he now did
this, to ſhew that the curſe was gone, and that
ſin was gone; and that action ſpeakes thus much,
as if Chriſt himſelfe had ſaid;<note place="margin">To ſhew the curſe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and their ſins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</note> 
                        <hi>O my brethren</hi>
(for ſo he ſtyled his Diſciples, after his <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>)
I have been <hi>dead,</hi> and in dying made a <hi>curſe</hi>
for you: now that <hi>curſe</hi> I have fully <hi>removed,</hi> and
my Father hath aquited me, and you, for it: and
now I can be bold to <hi>bleſſe</hi> you, and pronounce
all your <hi>ſins forgiven,</hi> and your perſons juſtified.
For that is the intendment and foundation of <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
[Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſins are forgiven him</hi>]
and therefore that was the true meaning of his
bleſſing them: which he reſerved thus as his laſt
Act, to ſhew, how by his death he had redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them from the curſe of the Law, &amp; now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Heaven,</hi> was able to <hi>bleſſe</hi> them with <hi>all the
ſpirituall bleſsings</hi> that are <hi>there,</hi> and which Heaven
can afford; for <hi>Heavenly</hi> they are called in that
reſpect,<note place="margin">And in bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles thus he bleſſed all that ſhould believe in him.</note> 
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. And as in <hi>Abraham</hi> (bleſſed
by <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi>) all the faithfull were bleſſed:
ſo, in theſe Apoſtles, all the elect to come are
bleſſed. As when <hi>God</hi> individually <hi>bleſſed Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve,</hi> at the firſt Creation, yet he <hi>in them,
bleſſed all</hi> that were for ever to come of them:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:155276:59"/>
ſo Chriſt in bleſſing them, bleſſed us, and all <hi>that
ſhall beleeve, through their word,</hi> to the end of the
World. And that they were thus then to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
as common perſons, receiving this <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi>
for us all; appeareth by Chriſts words then
uttered, [<hi>I am with you to the end of the World] (i. e.</hi>
with you, and all your ſucceſſors, both Miniſters,
&amp; other believers) <hi>Mat. 28. ult.</hi> And Chriſt herein
did, as God did before him: When <hi>God had done
his worke</hi> of creation, He <hi>looked upon all he had
done, and ſaw that it was good, and he bleſſed it:</hi>
Thus did Jeſus Chriſt; now that <hi>he had by that
one offering, perfected for ever all the elect,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
vieweth, and <hi>pronounceth</hi> it <hi>perfect,</hi> and
them bleſſed; and ſo goes to <hi>Heaven,</hi> to <hi>keepe</hi> and
<hi>enjoy</hi> the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of all there.</p>
                     <p>Now Secondly let us <hi>ſee him Aſcending;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A ſecond ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from the very Act of Aſcending.</note> and

as <hi>leading ſin, hell, death, and devill in triumph,</hi> at his

<hi>triumph,</hi> in a further <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>juſtification.</hi> Thus
<hi>Epheſians</hi> 4. 8. out of the 68. <hi>Pſalme ver.</hi> 18.
the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">How it was an act of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over death, hel, ſin, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>When he aſcended up on high [he

Latine phraſe [<hi>vincere victoriam</hi>] to win a victory
doth anſwer) then <hi>He</hi> led captive all our <hi>ſpirituall

now captived. Now <hi>leading of captives</hi> is alwaies
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:155276:60"/>
after a perfect <hi>victory.</hi> And therefore, whereas at
his <hi>Death</hi> he had <hi>conquered</hi> them, at his <hi>Riſing,
ſcattered</hi> them, now at his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> he <hi>leades them
captive:</hi> And ſo that <hi>Pſal.</hi> in the Type, begins, <hi>ver.</hi>
1. <hi>Let God [ariſe] and let his enemies [be ſcattered;]
let them flee before him:</hi> ſo at his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> they did:
And then he aſcends in triumph (ashere) in token
of <hi>victory,</hi> [he is aſcended up on high <hi>ver.</hi> 18.] he
aſcends as <hi>David</hi> after his victory, up to Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
(for the celebrating of which that <hi>Pſal.</hi> ſeemes
to have beene made by <hi>David</hi>) whereof this was
the intended Type.<note place="margin">Two Acts of Triumph in it.</note> And two [<hi>Actus triumphales]
triumphing Acts</hi> there were, here mentioned; 1. <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the captives</hi> bound to his Chariot wheeles; as
the manner of the Roman triumphs was, when the
Conqueror went up to the Capitol; and other
Heathens in <hi>Davids</hi> time: As <hi>Achilles</hi> led <hi>Hector</hi>
captive, who tied his feete to his Chariot wheels,
and dragged him dead round about the walls of
<hi>Troy:</hi> Now thus did Chriſt then deale with
our ſinnes, and all other enemies. The <hi>Second
act is caſting abroad of gifts, [He gave gifts to men.</hi>]
It was the <hi>cuſtome</hi> at their triumphs to <hi>caſt new
Coines [miſsilia</hi>] abroad among the multitude; ſo
doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> throw the greateſt <hi>gifts</hi> for the good of
men, that ever were given. Therefore, <hi>who ſhall
condemne? ſins</hi> and <hi>devills,</hi> are not only dead,
but <hi>triumphed over.</hi> Compare with this, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, <hi>Coloſ. 2. 15. Having ſpoiled Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and powers, he made a ſhew of them openly [tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing]
over them [in himſelf:</hi>] So I reade it, and
the Greeke beares it, and ſo it is in the margent
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:155276:60"/>
varied: it is a manifeſt alluſion unto the manner of
<hi>Triumphs</hi> after victories among <hi>the Romans;</hi> even
unto <hi>two</hi> of the moſt notable <hi>parts</hi> thereof; the
firſt of <hi>ſpoiling</hi> the enemie, upon the <hi>place,</hi> ere
they ſtirred out of the field: and this was done by
Chriſt on the Croſſe, [<hi>Having ſpoiled them firſt</hi>]
as <hi>ver.</hi> 14. hath it. He ſpeakes it of the devills our
enemies, and accuſers; they had all Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
in his Law, and the <hi>Ceermoniall Law</hi> (the
<hi>Bond</hi> for our debt unto the <hi>Morall Law</hi>) to ſhew for
it; in theſe lay the <hi>power of the Devill</hi> over us,
that he could boldly come to God and accuſe us,
and ſue our bond; And therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14.
he is ſaid to have <hi>the power of Death.</hi> Now Chriſt
firſt tooke away all his power, and ſpoiled him
of all his enſignes, weapons, and colours; which
he did on the place where the battail was fought,
namely, <hi>on the Croſſe;</hi> and <hi>nailed our bond</hi> thereto,
and having paid the debt, left the bond canceld,
ere he ſtirred off the Croſſe. But then having thus
ſpoiled theſe enemies on the Croſſe; hee further
makes a <hi>publique triumphall ſhew</hi> of them in his own
perſon, which is a ſecond Act; as the manner of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors was, in their great triumphs,
to ride through the City in the greateſt ſtate, and
have all the ſpoiles carried before them, and the
Kings and Nobles whom they had taken, they
tyed to their Chariots, and led them as Captives:
And this did Chriſt at <hi>his aſcenſion:</hi> (for of <hi>his trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing</hi>
at his Aſcenſion, I take this <hi>Triumph</hi> in this
Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſ.</hi> to be underſtood; and ſo to be

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:155276:61"/>
He plainly manifeſting by this publique open
ſhew of them at his Aſcenſion, that he had ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and fully ſubdued them on the Croſſe. That
which hath diverted Interpreters from thinking
this of 2. <hi>Col.</hi> to have been the triumph of his
Aſcenſion, hath been this, That the triumph is
ſaid to have been made [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] which they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
[<hi>in it</hi>] as if it referred to <hi>the Croſſe,</hi> (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>ver.</hi> 14.) as the place of it; when as it may
as well be tranſlated [<hi>in himſelfe</hi>] i. e. [<hi>in his own
power and ſtrength;</hi>] noting, how <hi>he alone</hi> did this,
which <hi>other Conquerours</hi> doe not; they conquer
<hi>not in themſelves,</hi> and by themſelves, which
Chriſt did. And yet it was the Law, that if the
<hi>Roman Emperours</hi> or <hi>Generals</hi> themſelves took any
thing in War, they had a peculiar honour to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
it in triumph more peculiarly: Now <hi>Chriſt
conquered in himſelfe,</hi> and therefore <hi>triumphed in
himſelfe,</hi> and himſelfe <hi>alone.</hi> And thus it became
our Redeemer (like another <hi>Sampſon</hi>) not onely
to <hi>break</hi> Sins bars, and fling off <hi>Hell-gates,</hi> and
come out of that Priſon he was in; but as in
ſigne of a <hi>Trophie,</hi> to take them on his <hi>back,</hi> and
<hi>carry</hi> them up the hill, (as <hi>Sampſon</hi> (the Type
of him) did the gates of the City to an high hill)
himſelfe triumphantly carrying them on his own
ſhoulders.</p>
                     <p>Now did <hi>Chriſt</hi> then, who was your <hi>Surety,</hi> thus
<hi>triumph?</hi> then let your <hi>faith triumph</hi> likewiſe; for
this was not onely done by your <hi>Surety,</hi> but in
<hi>your ſtead;</hi> ſeeing this [<hi>for us</hi>] here, is to be put to

Chriſt as a <hi>Surety undertook</hi> for ſinners, fully to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi>
all our enemies; and God bade him look that
he did it <hi>perfectly,</hi> or never ſee his face more: <hi>Heb.</hi>

hath ſatisfied the debt, and performed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

his head had peept into Heaven, have ſent him
downe again to performe the reſt; But God lets
him enter in, and he comes boldly, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
and God lets him ſtay there: therefore
be convinced, that he hath given God full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
<hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf uſeth <hi>this argument,</hi> as the
ſtrongeſt that could be brought to <hi>convince the
World,</hi> that his <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> (which he had in his

You may by the way obſerve, for the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration
of this: how upon all the ſeverall parts
of performance of his office, either God is
brought in ſpeaking to Chriſt, or Chriſt to his
Father. Thus when he <hi>choſe</hi> him <hi>firſt</hi> to be our
Mediator, he takes an oath, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for
ever after the order of Melchiſedec.</hi> Againe, when
Chriſt came to take upon him our nature, the
<hi>words</hi> he ſpake are recorded, <hi>Loe I come to doe thy
will, a body haſt thou fitted me:</hi> ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. out of the
40. <hi>Pſal.</hi> Likewiſe when he hung upon the Croſſe,
his words unto God are recorded, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 1.
<hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> In like

then to him are recorded, <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this
day have I begotten thee, Pſal.</hi> 2. (which place is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of <hi>the Reſurrection, Acts</hi> 13. 33.) which
is as much as if he had ſaid, Thou never appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redſt

a Son to be glorified with power and Majeſty,
hitherto thou haſt appeared onely as <hi>a Son of man,

owne thee for my Sonne indeed. And in him,
he owned us all, thus at his Reſurrection. And
then laſt of all when he comes into Heaven, the
firſt word God ſpeakes to him is, Sonne, <hi>ſit thou

done his worke; and that there is no more
left for him to do by way of <hi>ſatisfaction:</hi> This the
word [<hi>ſitting</hi>] implies. Secondly, It argues that

the force and excellencie of Chriſts Sacrifice,
with thoſe of the Prieſts of the old Law, ſayes,
that <hi>Thoſe Prieſts [ſtood] daily offering of Sacrifices,
which can never take ſins away.</hi> Their <hi>ſtanding</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
that they could never make ſatisfaction ſo,
as to ſay, <hi>We have finiſhed it:</hi> But Chriſt (ſayes
he, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.) <hi>after he had offered up one ſacrifice for
ever, [ſate downe</hi>] &amp;c. Mark how he oppoſeth
their <hi>ſtanding,</hi> to his <hi>ſitting downe.</hi> He ſate as one
who had done his work. Thus <hi>Heb. 4. 10. He that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:155276:63"/>
is entred into his reſt,</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt, as I have
elſewhere ſhewne) <hi>hath ceaſed from his work, as
God from his.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. That God alſo accepted it, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely well pleaſed with it.</note> this his being at <hi>Gods right hand,</hi> as
ſtrongly argues that God is ſatisfied: for if God
had not been infinitely well pleaſed with him, he
would never have let him come ſo neere him;
much leſſe have advanced him ſo high as <hi>his
right hand.</hi> And therefore in that place even now
cited, (<hi>Heb. 10. ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12. compared with
the former verſes) <hi>this</hi> is alledged as an <hi>evidence</hi>
that <hi>Chriſt had for ever taken ſinnes away,</hi> (which
thoſe Prieſts of the Law could not doe, who
therefore <hi>often offered the ſame Sacrifice,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 11.)
That <hi>this man, after he had offered one Sacrifice for
ſinnes for ever, [ſate downe on the right hand of God</hi>]
as thereby ſhewing (and that moſt manifeſtly)
that he had at that once offered up ſuch a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
Sacrifice, as had pleaſed God for ever; and
thereupon took up his <hi>place</hi> at Gods right hand, as
an <hi>evidence</hi> of it; ſo poſſeſſing the higheſt place in

<hi>token</hi> of <hi>ſpeciall</hi> and higheſt <hi>favour.</hi> So <hi>Kings</hi>
whom they were moſt pleaſed with, they <hi>did ſet</hi>
at <hi>their right hands,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> did his <hi>Mother,</hi>
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 19. and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> his <hi>Queen,
Pſal.</hi> 45. 9. and it was a favour which God never

<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. it is not onely ſaid that he <hi>exalted him,</hi>

his Diſciples of, <hi>Iohn 14. 2. In my Fathers houſe

[<hi>I go to prepare a place for you</hi>] and it is my
Fathers houſe (ſaith he) where I can provide for
you and make you welcome. You heard before,
what welcome God gave Chriſt, when he firſt
arrived there; and what he ſaid to him, and Chriſt
ſaid (as it were) again to God: I come not alone,
I have much company, many of my brethren,
and followers to come after (for it was the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi>
and avowed <hi>end</hi> of his comming <hi>to prepare</hi> a

<hi>that where I am they might be alſo; (Iohn</hi> 17.) and
now I am come hither, my traine muſt come in
too; I am not compleate without them, If you
receive me you muſt receive them alſo, and I am
come to take up lodgings for them. Thus the
Captain of our <hi>ſalvation, (being made perfect through

20. 22. this is made the priviledge of Gods <hi>ſetting
him at his right hand,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">All things committed to him.</note> 
                        <hi>ver.</hi> 20. that <hi>he hath put all
things under his feete, ver.</hi> 22. A phraſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the higheſt ſoveraignty and power, not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of any Creatures, Angels, or Men: none of
them have other things <hi>under their feet, (i. e.</hi>) in ſo
low a ſubjection as to be their vaſſals; eſpecially,
not [<hi>all] things;</hi> and therefore by that very phraſe,
<hi>the putting all things under his feete,</hi> the Apoſtle
argues in that ſecond to the <hi>Heb.</hi> that <hi>that man</hi> of
whom <hi>David</hi> in the 8. <hi>Pſalm</hi> (there cited by
him) had ſpoken, was no other but Chriſt;
not <hi>Adam,</hi> nor the <hi>Angells;</hi> for to neither of
theſe hath God ſubjected <hi>all things, ver.</hi> 5. but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:155276:67"/>
to <hi>Chriſt</hi> onely <hi>ver.</hi> 8. who <hi>ſits in the higheſt Throne
of Majeſty:</hi> And to make his ſeate the eaſier, hath
a world of <hi>enemies made his foote-ſtoole,</hi> even <hi>all his
enemies;</hi> (ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.) which is the higheſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
in the world. Now to what end hath God
committed this power to him,<note place="margin">Which power God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him to ſave his Elect.</note> but that himſelfe
may be his owne Executor, and Adminiſtrator,
and performe all the Legacies which he made
to thoſe whom hee died for? as the expreſſion is
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16, and 17. <hi>verſes.</hi> that none of his
heires might be wronged. Fairer dealing then
this could there ever be, nor greater ſecurity gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to us. This to have beene Gods very end
of inveſting <hi>Chriſt</hi> with this ſoveraigne power,
is declared by Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Iohn 17. 2. Thou
haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould</hi> give
<hi>eternall life to as many as thou haſt given him:</hi> And
accordingly at his <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> to comfort his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
in the fruit of their Miniſtery, <hi>Mat,</hi> 21. 18.
he ſaies, <hi>All power is given to mee in Heaven. and in
Earth.</hi> What holy confidence may this breede in
us? <hi>He</hi> is at <hi>Gods right hand,</hi> and <hi>we are in his hands,
Iohn</hi> 10. 28. and <hi>all</hi> his <hi>Enemies</hi> are <hi>under his feete,
who then can pul us out? Revel.</hi> 1. 18. ſaies Chriſt,
<hi>I have the Keyes of Hell and Death.</hi> The <hi>Key</hi> is ſtill
in the Scripture phraſe the Enſigne of <hi>Power</hi>
and <hi>authority.</hi> Now Chriſt hath, both, the <hi>Keyes</hi>
of <hi>Death,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">What ſecurity this affords.</note> the poſtern gate out of this world; and
of <hi>Hell,</hi> even of the broad gates of that eternall
priſon; So as none of his can be fetched out of
this world by Death, but Chriſt he muſt firſt
open the <hi>doore;</hi> much leſſe, can any go to Hell
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:155276:67"/>
without his warrant. Yea <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. He
hath <hi>the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven</hi> alſo, to
open to whom he will. By his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> we
may ſee and reſt aſſured, that he hath the <hi>Keyes of
Death</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> (for he unlockt the doors, and
came out from thence) and by his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> and
<hi>ſitting at Gods right hand,</hi> that he hath the <hi>Keyes of
heaven,</hi> whoſe doore he hath unlockt, and now
ſet open. What need we then feare <hi>Hell,</hi> when
Chriſt our Redeemer hath the keyes of it?</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Prerogative. All judgement and authority committed to him.</note> to ſit at Gods right hand, imports
<hi>all judgement to be committed to him:</hi> for <hi>ſitting</hi> was
a poſture of <hi>Iudges;</hi> a phraſe uſed to note out
their authority. So <hi>Prov. 20. 8. A King that [ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth]
on the throne of judgement, ſcattereth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with his eyes:</hi> and ſo doth Chriſt his and our
enemies. See what Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 21, 22.
<hi>The Sonne of man raiſeth up whom he will; for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
[judgeth] no man, but [hath committed all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment]
to the Sonne.</hi> Now if he who loved us ſo,
and dyed for us, be the <hi>Iudge</hi> himſelfe, then <hi>Who
ſhall condemne? Chriſt ſits on Gods right hand.</hi> This is
the very inference that after followeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. of
that 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Iohn, He that beleeves, ſhall not come
into condemnation:</hi> Chriſt utters it upon his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſaid he had <hi>all judgement committed to him,</hi> in
the fore-going <hi>ver.</hi> 22. on purpoſe that he might
from that conſideration, aſcertaine Beleevers of
their <hi>non-condemnation.</hi> For what need we feare
any Under-officers,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> when we have the Judge
thus for us?<note place="margin">2. Particular. Both which being his, as he is an Head to his Elect.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then (in the laſt place) add that ſecond par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:155276:68"/>
mentioned to all theſe, that Chriſt <hi>ſits there</hi>
as <hi>an Head,</hi> as a <hi>Common perſon,</hi> for us. Firſt as <hi>an
Head;</hi> ſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. when the Apoſtle had ſo hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically
ſet forth his <hi>power,</hi> of being advanced <hi>unto
Gods right hand, ver. 21. farre above all Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and powers, and above every name that is named,
not only in this world, but that which is to come;</hi> and
how God <hi>hath put all things under his feet:</hi> he adds,
and [<hi>hath given him to be head over all things</hi> to the
<hi>Church.</hi>] Obſerve now, he is ſaid to ſit there <hi>over
all</hi> things, not in his <hi>own pure perſonall right</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
as it is his <hi>inheritance,</hi> as he is the Son of God,
(as <hi>Heb. 1. ver.</hi> 3, 4, 5. it is affirmed of him) but
he ſits thus over all as a <hi>Head to the Church.</hi> That
ſame [<hi>over all things</hi>] comes in there, betweene
his being a [<hi>Head</hi>] and [<hi>to the Chuch,</hi>] on purpoſe
to ſhew, that he is <hi>ſet over all, in relation to his
Church:</hi> So that we ſee, that our relation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved,
and our right included in this exaltation
of his, and ſo put into his commiſſion; for this
prerogative is there ſaid to be <hi>given him.</hi> He ſits
not ſimply as a <hi>Son,</hi> but as an <hi>Head;</hi> and he ſits not
as an <hi>Head</hi> without a <hi>Body,</hi> and therefore muſt
have his Members up to him: Wherefore in the
next <hi>ver.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Therefore hee muſt have all his members up to him.</note> it is added, <hi>Which is his body, yea, his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi>
ſo as Chriſt is not compleat without all his
Members, and would leave heaven, if any one
were wanting; It were a lame, maimed body,
if it wanted but a toe. Chriſt is our <hi>Element,</hi> and
he being aſcended, we are <hi>ſparks</hi> that fly upwards
to him. He took our <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and carryed it unto
heaven, and left us his <hi>Spirit</hi> on earth, and both

as pawnes and earneſts that we ſhould follow.</p>
                     <p>Nay farther yet,<note place="margin">Eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſits as repreſenting them, and they ſit together with him.</note> he is not onely ſaid to ſit as
our Head, but we are alſo ſaid to <hi>ſit together with
him:</hi> That is, made the up-ſhot of all in the next
Chapter, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 6. So that as we <hi>aroſe</hi> with
him, (he being conſidered as a Common perſon)
and <hi>aſcended</hi> with him, as was ſaid; So yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we <hi>ſit together with him in the higheſt heavens,</hi>
(as there) <gap reason="foreign">

of that phraſe): not that <hi>Chriſts being at Gods

communicable to us;<note place="margin">How to ſit at Gods right hand is Chriſts prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative alone.</note> that is Chriſts prerogative
onely: So <hi>Heb. 1. 5. To which of all the Angels did

his <hi>ſitting in heaven,</hi> as it is indefinitely expreſſed,
is underſtood to be as in our right and ſtead, and
as a Common perſon; and ſo is to aſſure us of
<hi>our ſitting</hi> there with him,<note place="margin">And yet, How we may be ſaid to ſit in his Throne.</note> in <hi>our proportion.</hi> So <hi>Rev.</hi>

that is, <hi>Chriſt</hi> onely ſits at <hi>Gods right hand;</hi> but <hi>we,</hi>
on <hi>Chriſts right hand:</hi> And ſo the <hi>Church</hi> is ſaid

                        <note place="margin">And repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents our ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day as Judges with him.</note>

and <hi>Luke 22. 30. When the Sonne of Man ſhall ſit in

Tribes of Iſrael.</hi> So as this <hi>our ſitting</hi> with him, it is
ſpoken in reſpect to <hi>Iudgement,</hi> and to <hi>giving the
ſentence</hi> of it; not a ſentence ſhall paſſe without
your votes: So as you may by faith not onely
look on your ſelves, as already in heaven, ſitting

but you may look upon your ſelves as Judges al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo:
So that if any ſinne ſhould ariſe to accuſe or

what greater ſecurity can you have then this?
for you muſt condemne your ſelves, if you be
condemned: you may very well ſay, <hi>Who ſhall
accuſe? Who ſhall condemne?</hi> for you will never
pronounce a fatall ſentence upon your owne
ſelves.</p>
                     <p>As then <hi>Paul</hi> triumphed here,<note place="margin">The triumph of faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</note> ſo may we; for at

                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:155276:71"/>
For the firſt, I will proceede therein by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is one part of his Prieſt-hood. You
muſt know, that Chriſt is not entred into heaven
ſimply, as a <hi>fore-runner</hi> (which hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained)
to take up places for you, but as a
Prieſt alſo: <hi>Made a Prieſt, after the order of
Melchiſedec;</hi> which is more then ſimply a <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner.</hi>
Yea, his ſitting at Gods right hand is
not onely as <hi>a King</hi> armed with power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to ſave us; but he <hi>ſits</hi> there as a <hi>Prieſt</hi>
too: Thus <hi>Heb. 8. 1. We have ſuch an High Prieſt
who is ſet downe at the right hand of the Majeſty on
high.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the old Leviticall Prieſt-hood,<note place="margin">Two parts of the High-Prieſts office.</note> the High-Prieſts
office had two parts, both which concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to make them High-Prieſts.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Oblation, or offering the Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Preſentation of it in the Holy
of Holies, with Prayer and Interceſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, to accept it for the ſinnes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The one was done <hi>without,</hi> the other <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
the Holy of Holies. This you may ſee in
many places; eſpecially <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 11, 15, 16.
where you have the Law about the High Prieſts
entring into the Holy of Holies; he was not to
come into the holy place, till firſt he had offered
a Sacrifice for himſelfe and the people, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.
and 15. and this <hi>without.</hi> Then ſecondly, when
he had killed it, he was to enter with the bloud
of it into the Holy of Holies, and ſprinkle the
Mercie-ſeat therein with it, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 17. and to go
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:155276:72"/>
                        <hi>with Incenſe,</hi> and <hi>cauſe a cloud to ariſe</hi> over the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie-ſeat:
And this you have alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 11. it is
ſaid, that <hi>The bloud of thoſe beaſts that were burnt
without the Camp, was brought into the Sanctuary by
the High-Prieſt:</hi> And in that 16. of <hi>Levit.</hi> you ſhall
finde the <hi>Atonement</hi> made as well by the <hi>bloud,</hi>
when brought into the Holy place, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. as by
the <hi>killing of the beaſt, ver.</hi> 11. Both theſe were
acts of the High-prieſthood for Atonement.</p>
                     <p>And this was done in a Type of the Prieſtly
office of Chriſt, and the parts thereof: So <hi>Heb.</hi>
9. 23. he cals all thoſe tranſactions under the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall
Law, the [<hi>patterns] of things heavenly;</hi>
inſtancing in this part of Chriſts office, <hi>ver.</hi> 24.
<hi>For Chriſt</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>is not entred into the Holy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
made without hands,</hi> (as that was) <hi>which are [the
figures of the true,] but into heaven it ſelfe, to appear
in the preſence of God for us.</hi> Now then in anſwer to
this Type, there are two diſtinct parts of Chriſts
Prieſthood:</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Chriſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> the <hi>offering himſelfe a Sacrifice</hi> up to death,
as <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. which anſwers to the killing of the
Sacrifice <hi>without the Holy of Holies:</hi> for anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
he was crucified <hi>without the City, Heb.</hi> 13. 12.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Heavens</hi> to <hi>Intercede.</hi>
                        </note> he <hi>carryed</hi> this his <hi>bloud</hi> into the <hi>Holy
of Holies,</hi> namely, the <hi>Heavens, Heb.</hi> 9. 12. where
he <hi>appeares, ver.</hi> 24. and there alſo <hi>prayes</hi> in the
force of that bloud. And the Type of thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
was that <hi>cloud of Incenſe</hi> made by the High-Prieſt;
ſo it is expreſly interpreted, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3. &amp;c.
The Angel Chriſt is ſaid to have had <hi>much Incenſe,
to offer it with the prayers of all the Saints:</hi> Which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:155276:72"/>
Incenſe is his owne prayers in heaven, which he
continually puts up when the Saints pray on
earth, and ſo perfumes all their prayers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
all bleſſings for them.</p>
                     <p>Both theſe parts of his Priſt-hood the Apoſtle
<hi>Iohn</hi> mentions in his firſt Epiſtle,<note place="margin">Both proved.</note> 
                        <hi>Chap. 2. ver.</hi> 2.
where, as he cals Jeſus Chriſt a <hi>propitiation for our
ſins;</hi> (that is, an <hi>Oblation,</hi> or <hi>Sacrifice</hi> offered up for
us:) So likewiſe he cals him our <hi>Advocate:</hi> both
going to make up this his office. And indeed, this
latter of Interceſſion, and bringing his bloud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Holy of Holies, (or heaven) is but the ſame
action continued. That bloud which he offered
with tears and ſtrong cryes on the Croſſe, (where
he likewiſe interceded,) the ſame bloud he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
virtually to offer up with prayers in the
heavens, and makes Atonement by both; onely
with this difference: <hi>On earth,</hi> though <hi>he interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
yet he <hi>more eminently offered up</hi> himſelfe; <hi>In
heaven,</hi> he more eminently intercedes, and doth
but <hi>preſent that Offering.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, this was ſo neceſſary a part of his
Prieſt-hood, that without it he had not been a
<hi>compleat Prieſt.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion he had not been a perfect Prieſt.</note> Thus <hi>Heb. 8. 4. If he were on
earth, he ſhould not be a Prieſt:</hi> That is, If he ſhould
have abode on earth, he ſhould not have been a
<hi>compleat Prieſt. Paul</hi> ſaith not, that if he had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that his ſacrifice on earth, he had not been a
Prieſt, for that was neceſſary; but that if he had
ſtaid ſtill on earth, after he had offered it, he had
not been a Prieſt, that is, a perfect Prieſt; for
he had then left his office imperfect, and had
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:155276:73"/>
done it but by halves, ſeeing this other part of it
(the work of Interceſſion) lay ſtill upon him to be
acted in heaven. Thus the High-prieſt, his Type, if
he had only offered Sacrifice without the Holy of
holies, had not been a perfect High-Prieſt: For
to enter into the Holy of holies, and to act the
part of a Prieſt there,<note place="margin">This the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar work of the High-Prieſt, who was in this Chriſts Type.</note> was the proper, peculiar
work of <hi>the High-Prieſt,</hi> as ſuch. Which ſhews,
that Chriſt had not been an High-Prieſt, if he
had not gone to heaven, and Prieſted it there too,
(as I may ſo ſpeak) as well as upon earth. Yea, if
Chriſt had not gone to heaven, and were not
now become a Prieſt there, then the Leviticall
Prieſt-hood were ſtill in force, and ſhould ſhare
the honour with him; and the High-prieſt muſt
continue ſtill to goe into the Holy of holies. To
this purpoſe you may obſerve, that ſo long as
Chriſt was on earth, though riſen, the Types of
the Law held in force, and were not to give way,
till all the truth ſignified by their Miniſtery, was
fully accompliſht; and ſo, not untill Chriſt was
gone into heaven, as a Prieſt, and there had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to doe all that which the High-prieſt had
done in the Holy of holies, and as his Type fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignified.
And this is plainly the meaning of what
follows (in that <hi>Heb. 8. ver.</hi> 4.) as the reaſon or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
why that Chriſt ſhould not have been
a Prieſt, if he had not gone to heaven, (not onely
as a King, but as a <hi>Prieſt</hi> too, as he had affirmed,
<hi>ver.</hi> 1.) <hi>Seeing</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that there are Prieſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, that doe offer gifts according to the Law.</hi>
The force of the Reaſon lyes thus: There are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:155276:73"/>
already Prieſts, and that of a Tribe he was not
of, that <hi>offer gifts on earth,</hi> before he came into the
world. And therefore if that had beene all his
Prieſt-hood, to be a <hi>Prieſt on earth,</hi> they would
plead poſſeſſion before him, having been Prieſts
before him. And then he further backs his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
by this, that <hi>thoſe Prieſts ſerved</hi> (as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<hi>ver.</hi> 5.) <hi>unto the example and ſhadow of heavenly
things.</hi> And therefore it is onely a <hi>reall</hi> Prieſt-hood
in Heaven which muſt put them out of
place; and till ſuch a Prieſthood comes, they
muſt ſerve ſtill, for the <hi>truth</hi> (which theſe ſerved
to ſhadow out) is not till then fulfilled. This you
have alſo, <hi>Ch.</hi> 9. 8. The <hi>firſt Tabernacle was to ſtand</hi>
untill a <hi>Prieſt went into Heaven,</hi> and did act that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
there: ſo that if Chriſt will be a <hi>Prieſt alone,</hi> he
muſt become a Prieſt interceding in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: or elſe
High-prieſts muſt come up again, and ſhare that
office with him; and ſo hee ſhould as good as
fall from his office, and loſe all that he had done.</p>
                     <p>Yea, thirdly, <hi>this part</hi> of his Prieſthood, is
of the two the more eminent, yea, the <hi>top,</hi> the
<hi>height</hi> of his <hi>Prieſthood;</hi> And this is held forth to
us, in the Types of both thoſe <hi>two orders</hi> of
Prieſthood that were before him, and figures of
him; both that of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedec:</hi> 1 This
was typified out in that Leviticall Prieſthood of
<hi>Aaron</hi> and his fellows: The <hi>higheſt ſervice</hi> of that
office, was the going into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and
making an <hi>atonement</hi> there: yea this was the
height of the High prieſts honour, that he did this
alone, and did conſtitute the <hi>difference</hi> between
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:155276:74"/>
                        <hi>him (as he was High prieſt,</hi>) and <hi>other Prieſts:</hi> For
they killed and offered the ſacrifices without as
well as he, every ordinary Prieſt did that: But
none but the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> was to approach the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of holies with bloud, and this <hi>but once a yeere.</hi>
Thus <hi>Heb. 9. 6, 7. The Prieſts</hi> (namely thoſe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Prieſts) <hi>went alwayes</hi> (that is, daily, morning
and evening) <hi>into the firſt Tabernacle,</hi> (or Court of
Prieſts, which was without the Holy of holies)
<hi>accompliſhing the ſervice of God;</hi> namely, that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the daily ſacrifice: <hi>But into the ſecond,</hi>
(namely, the Holy of holies) <hi>went the [High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts]
alone every yeere:</hi> So then this was that
high and tranſcendent prerogative of that <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Prieſt</hi>
then, and which indeed made him <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt;</hi>
and anſwerably the highth of our High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts
office (although he alone alſo could offer a
ſatisfactory ſacrifice, as the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Heb.</hi>
9. and 10. yet comparatively) lay in this, that he
entred into the heavens by his bloud, and is ſet
downe on the Majeſty on high, and in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his ſacrifice there doth intercede. I know
but one place that calleth him the <hi>Great High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt,</hi>
(higher before then <hi>Aaron</hi>) and that is,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 14, 16. And then it is in <hi>this</hi> reſpect, that
<hi>he is paſſed into the Heavens,</hi> as it follows there.</p>
                     <p>2. The excellency of this part of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
was likewiſe typified out by <hi>Melchiſedechs</hi>
Prieſt-hood, which the Apoſtle argueth to have
been much more excellent then that of <hi>Aarons,</hi> in
as much as <hi>Levi, Aarons</hi> Father, payed Tythes to
this <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loyns. Now <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech</hi>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:155276:74"/>
was his type, not ſo much in reſpect of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or offering of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> (that work which
Chriſt performed <hi>on earth</hi>) but in reſpect of that
work which he [<hi>for ever</hi>] performs in <hi>Heaven:</hi>
therefore that ſame clauſe (<hi>for ever</hi>) ſtill comes
in, in the quotation and mention of <hi>Melchiſedechs</hi>
prieſthood in that <hi>Epiſtle;</hi> becauſe in reſpect of that
his continuall interceſſion in Heaven, <hi>Melchiſedech</hi>
was properly Chriſts type. And accordingly you
may obſerve, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. when is it that that ſpeech
comes in [<hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of
Melchiſedech</hi>] but then, when God had him <hi>ſitting
at his right hand, ver.</hi> 1. So that as the tranſcendent
excellencie of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Prieſthood was typified out
by <hi>Melchiſedechs</hi> rather then <hi>Aarons,</hi> as being the
better prieſthood of the two; ſo this, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
part thereof, was typified out thereby,
namely, that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Chriſt for ever acteth in heaven.</p>
                     <p>And 3.<note place="margin">This the chief argument of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Heb.</hi>
                        </note> To confirm this, you ſhall find <hi>this</hi> to be
made the <hi>top notion of this Epiſtle to the Heb.</hi> and the
ſcope of it chiefly to diſcourſe of Chriſts eternall
Prieſthood in heaven; &amp; to ſhew how therein <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi>
was a type of him. This is not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
both in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 21. and 25. where this ſame
[<hi>for ever</hi>] is applyed to his Interceſſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. but
more expreſly in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 1. where the Apoſtle puts
the emphaſis upon this part of his Prieſthood,
ſaying, <hi>That of the things which we have ſpoken, or
which are to be ſpoken,</hi> (for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.
will beare either) <hi>this is</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the ſumme</hi>
or <hi>argument</hi> of all: the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
as well <hi>The head, the chiefe, the top</hi> of all, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:155276:75"/>
above all, as it doth the ſum of all: And what is it
that he thus profeſſeth to be both the maine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and argument of this Epiſtle, and the top and
eminent thing in Chriſt he intends to diſcourſe
of? It follows, That <hi>We have [ſuch an High-Prieſt]
as is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
in the heavens.</hi> And of the <hi>Prieſtly office</hi> he alone
diſcourſeth both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after;</hi> and in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>verſes</hi> calleth his Miniſterie or <hi>office,</hi> (in reſpect
to this) <hi>A more excellent Miniſterie, ver. 6. he being
ſuch a Prieſt as was higher then the heavens,</hi> as he had
ſet him out in the latter part of the former <hi>Chap.</hi>
And therefore you may obſerve, how in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to this Epiſtle to the <hi>Heb.</hi> in the firſt <hi>Chap. ver.</hi>
3. he holds up this to our eye, as the argument of
the whole, ſaying, <hi>When he had by himſelf purged our
ſins, he ſat down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea,<note place="margin">His oblation elſe would have beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall.</note> to conclude this, <hi>All</hi> his <hi>Prieſthood</hi> would
have been ineffectuall, if he had not acted the
part of a Prieſt in heaven, by <hi>Interceſsion</hi> there:
for by his death he did but begin the execution
of his office; in heaven he ends it: and if he had
not fulfilled his office in both, the worke of our
ſalvation had not beene fully perfected: it was
therefore as neceſſary as oblation it ſelf. Not but
that his <hi>Death</hi> was a perfect oblation: it was <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
for an oblation,</hi> to which <hi>as ſuch</hi> nothing can be
added. There needed no more, nor anyother price
to be paid for us; <hi>by that one offering,</hi> he <hi>perfects
us for ever;</hi> as <hi>Heb. 10. 14. and became</hi> himſelfe
<hi>perfect thereby, Heb.</hi> 5. 9. And in the 9. <hi>Chapter
ver. 12. By his own bloud he entred into the Holy place,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:155276:75"/>
[having obtained] eternall redemption for us.</hi> Mark
how before he entred by his bloud into heaven,
he had fully [<hi>obtained</hi>] a redemption, and that
<hi>eternall,</hi> that is, for ever ſufficient; which done, he
became through his Interceſſion in heaven <hi>an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
cauſe</hi> of eternall ſalvation, a <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 10, 11.
hath it. So that as in his death he paid the full
ſumme of all he owed: unto which payment no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be added, (no not by himſelfe; though
he would come and die again, it was made at that
[<hi>once</hi>] as <hi>perfect</hi> (that is, <hi>for an oblation</hi>) as ever
himſelfe could make) But yet ſtill by Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
there remained <hi>another</hi> further <hi>action</hi> of
another kind that was to be added to this of obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that is <hi>Interceſsion,</hi> or <hi>praying</hi> for us in
<hi>Heaven:</hi> otherwiſe our ſalvation by his death were
not perfected: for if his Prieſthood be imperfect,
our ſalvation then muſt needs be ſo. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
of that his Sacrifice in heaven, was the
<hi>conſummation of his Prieſthood,</hi> and the performance
of that part there, the <hi>perfection of it.</hi>

ſatisfaction unto Juſtice; therefore this
<hi>free grace</hi> muſt be ſought to, and treated with
like it ſelfe, and applyed unto in all, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
and <hi>freeneſſe</hi> of it acknowledged in all,
even as well as <hi>Gods Iuſtice</hi> had the honour to
be <hi>ſatisfied</hi> by a <hi>price</hi> paid unto it, that ſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of it might appeare and be held forth
in our ſalvation. Thus God having <hi>two attributes</hi>
eminently to be dealt withall, his Juſtice and his
free Grace, it was meete that there ſhould be two
<hi>eminent actions</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Prieſthood,</hi> wherein he
ſhould apply himſelfe to each according to their
kind, and as the nature and glory of each doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
And accordingly in his death he deals with
<hi>Iuſtice,</hi> by laying downe a ſufficient price; and
in his Interceſſion, he entreateth <hi>Free grace,</hi> and
thus both come to be alike acknowledged. In the
4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 16. we are encouraged to <hi>come boldly</hi> [to
the <hi>Throne of grace</hi>] becauſe we <hi>have an High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt
entred into the Heavens:</hi> Obſerve how it
is called [<hi>a Throne of grace</hi>] which our High-prieſt
now in heaven officiates at: So called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his Prieſthood there deals with free grace
chiefly, it is a Throne <hi>of Grace,</hi> and ſo to be
ſued unto; therefore he treateth with God by
<hi>way of Interceſsion.</hi> Of this <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:155276:77"/>
heaven, the <hi>Mercie-ſeat</hi> in the Holy of holies was the
Type. And as there the High-prieſt was to bring
the <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>Mercie-ſeat</hi> together, he was to ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
the bloud upon it; ſo Chriſt. And as the High-Prieſt
was to go into the Holy of holies by <hi>bloud,</hi>
ſo with <hi>Incenſe</hi> alſo, (that is, <hi>Prayer:</hi>) To ſhew, that
<hi>Heaven</hi> is <hi>not opened</hi> by meere <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> or bringing
onely a <hi>price</hi> in hand for it; but by <hi>Grace</hi> alſo, and
that muſt be <hi>entreated;</hi> and therefore when the
Prieſt was within that holy place, he was to make
a <hi>Cloud</hi> over the Mercie-ſeat, (which cloud of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
is Prayer, whereof Incenſe was the Type,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3.) And thence it is, that Chriſt hath as
much work of it ſtill in heaven as ever, though of
another kind: He dealt with <hi>Iuſtice</hi> here <hi>below,</hi> to
<hi>ſatisfie</hi> it, and here got mony enough to pay the
debt; but in <hi>heaven</hi> he deals with <hi>Mercy.</hi> Therefore
all the Grace he beſtows on us, he is ſaid firſt to
<hi>receive</hi> it, even now when in heaven. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 33.
it is ſaid of him, after his going to heaven, and
that he was <hi>exalted,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>he received the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of the Spirit,</hi> which <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 16. he told them
he would <hi>pray for.</hi> And this is part of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that in <hi>Pſal. 68. 18. He aſcended up on high,
and [received] gifts for men,</hi> ſayes the Pſalmiſt:
The Apoſtle renders it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. [<hi>gave</hi>] but you
ſee, it was by <hi>receiving</hi> them firſt, as fruits of his
Interceſſion and asking after his aſcending; He
is ſaid both to <hi>give,</hi> as being all of his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe;
and as having power as a King alſo both to
doe and beſtow all he doth, and yet withall he is
ſaid to <hi>receive</hi> all that he <hi>gives,</hi> becauſe <hi>as a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:155276:78"/>
Prieſt</hi> he intercedes for it, and <hi>asks it.</hi> Free grace
requires this. This is the firſt thing.</p>
                     <p>Yea,<note place="margin">2. Gods juſtice ſtood upon it.</note> Secondly, Juſtice it ſelfe might ſtand a
little upon it, though there was enough in Chriſt
his death to ſatisfie it; yet having been wronged,
it ſtood thus far upon it, (as thoſe to whom a
debt is due, uſe to doe) namely, to have the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
brought home to Gods dwelling houſe, and
laid downe there. God is reſolved not to ſtoope
one whit unto man, no nor to Chriſt his Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Juſtice will not onely be ſatisfied, and have
a ſufficient ranſome collected and paid, as at
Chriſts death; but he muſt come and bring his
bags up to heaven: juſtice will be paid it upon
the Mercie-ſeate: For ſo in the Type the blood
was to be carried into the Holy of holies, and
ſprinkled upon the Mercie-ſeat. And therefore
his Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, &amp;c. were but as the
breaking through all enemies, &amp; ſubduing them,
to the end to bring this price or ſatisfaction to the
Mercie-ſeat; and ſo God having his money by
him, might not want wherewithall to pardon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
ſo as the blood of Chriſt is currant money,
not only on earth, but in heaven too, whither all is
brought, which is for our comfort, that all the
treaſure which ſhould ſatisfie God, is ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
thither, and our Surety with it.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſort of reaſons why God ordained
Chriſts interceſſion to be joyned to his Death,<note place="margin">Second ſort of reaſons, it was beſt for the effecting our Salvation.</note>
are taken from what was the beſt way to effect
and make ſure our ſalvation, and ſecure our

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:155276:78"/>
peculiar <hi>influence</hi> that Interceſſion hath into our
Salvation, and therein as in the former.</p>
                     <p>Firſt <hi>in generall,</hi> God would have our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
made ſure, and us ſaved all manner of
wayes, over and over.<note n="1" place="margin">1. In generall, God would have us ſaved all manner of wayes.</note> By <hi>ranſome</hi> and <hi>price,</hi>
(as Captives are redeemed) which was done by
his <hi>Death,</hi> which of it ſelfe was enough; for it
is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. to <hi>perfect us for ever.</hi>
                        <note n="2" place="margin">2. The <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to us from Chriſts Interceſſion.</note> By <hi>power</hi>

but God would have all wayes concurre in
it; whereof notwithſtanding not one could fail; a

enough, but all together muſt of neceſſity hold.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The whole <hi>Application</hi> of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
both in <hi>juſtifying</hi> and <hi>ſaving</hi> of us firſt
and laſt, hath a ſpeciall dependance upon this his
<hi>Interceſsion.</hi> This all Divines on all ſides doe
attribute unto it whilſt they put this difference
betweene the influence of his death, and <hi>that</hi> of his
interceſſion into our ſalvation; calling his <hi>death
Medium impetrationis;</hi> that is, <hi>the meanes of procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
or <hi>obtaining</hi> it for us; But his interceſſion,
<hi>Medium applicationis,</hi> the <hi>Meanes</hi> of <hi>applying</hi> all <hi>unto
us.</hi> Chriſt purchaſeth ſalvation by the one, but
<hi>poſſeſſeth</hi> us of it by the other: Some have attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
the <hi>Application</hi> of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> to his <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi>
but it is much more proper to aſcribe it to
his <hi>Interceſsion;</hi> (and what cauſall influence his
<hi>Reſurrection</hi> hath into our <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> hath been
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:155276:79"/>
afore in the third Section declared.) But that his
eternall <hi>Prieſthood</hi> in heaven, and the work of its
<hi>Interceſsion,</hi> is the <hi>applying</hi> cauſe of our eternall
<hi>ſalvation,</hi> in all the parts of it, firſt and laſt, ſeems
to me to be the reſult of the connexion of the
8, 9, and 10. <hi>verſes</hi> of the 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi>
For having ſpoken of his <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>ſufferings</hi>
unto <hi>death, ver.</hi> 8. and how he thereby was <hi>made

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) <hi>of eternall ſalvation, unto all them that
obey him;</hi> and this by his being become an <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Prieſt in heaven,</hi> after he was thus perfected
by ſufferings: for ſo it follows, <hi>ver. 10. Called of
God an High-prieſt, after the order of Melchiſedech:</hi>
And <hi>Melchiſedechs Prieſthood</hi> was principally the
type of his <hi>Prieſthood in heaven,</hi> as was before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
One leading inſtance to ſhew that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
was to be the applying cauſe of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was given by Chriſt, whilſt he was on earth,
thereby manifeſting what much more was to be
done by him in heaven, through his <hi>Interceſsion</hi>
there: when he was on the Croſſe, and as then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
that great ſacrifice for ſin, he at that time
alſo joyned prayers for the juſtification of thoſe
that crucified him, <hi>Father, [forgive] them, for they
know not what they doe:</hi> So fulfilling that in <hi>Eſay</hi>
53. <hi>ult. He bare the ſins of many, and made Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for the tranſgreſſours.</hi> And the efficacie of that
prayer then put up, was the cauſe of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of thoſe three thouſand, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. whom <hi>ver.</hi>
35. the Apoſtle had expreſly charged with the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:155276:79"/>
                        <hi>crucifying</hi> of Chriſt, whom <hi>ye by wicked hands have
taken, crucified, and ſlaine.</hi> Theſe were the firſt
fruits of his Interceſſion, whoſe prayers ſtill doe
reap and bring in the reſt of the crop, which in
all ages is to grow up unto God on earth.</p>
                     <p>3. And <hi>more particularly,</hi> as the whole Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in generall, ſo our <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> in the whole
progreſſe of it, depends upon Chriſts <hi>Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
As</p>
                     <p>1.<note place="margin">1 The firſt act of our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and our converſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it.</note> Our firſt <hi>actuall</hi> or <hi>initiall Iuſtification,</hi> (which
is given us at our firſt converſion) depends upon
<hi>Chriſts Interceſsion:</hi> Therefore in the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
prayer on the Croſſe, the thing he prayed
for was <hi>Forgivenes, Father forgive them.</hi> You heard
before that Chriſts death affords the matter of
our juſtification, as being <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>imputed,</hi>
the ranſome, the price, the thing it ſelf that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies:
And that his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was the <hi>originall act</hi>
of. Gods juſtifying <hi>us in Chriſt;</hi> We were <hi>virtually
juſtified then</hi> in Chriſt his being juſtifyed as in a
<hi>Common Perſon.</hi> But beſides all this, there is a <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
or an <hi>actuall Iuſtification</hi> to be beſtowed upon
us, that is, an accounting and beſtowing it upon us
in our own <hi>perſons;</hi> which is done whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we beleeve,
and it is called (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1.) <hi>a being juſtifyed by faith,</hi>
and (<hi>ver.</hi> 10.) <hi>receiving the atonement:</hi> now this
depends upon Chriſts <hi>Interceſsion;</hi> and it was ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified
out by <hi>Moſes his ſprinkling the people with
blood,</hi> mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 19. which thing Jeſus
Chriſt as a <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Prieſt</hi> doth now <hi>from
Heaven:</hi> For <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. it is ſaid, <hi>You are come to
Heaven, and to Ieſus the Mediator of the new Covenant,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:155276:80"/>
and</hi> (as it is next ſubjoyned) <hi>to the blood of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:</hi>
he <hi>ſhed</hi> his <hi>blood</hi> on the <hi>Croſſe</hi> on earth, but he
<hi>ſprinkleth</hi> it now as a Prieſt from <hi>Heaven:</hi> For it is
upon <hi>Mount Sion, to which</hi> (he had ſaid firſt in the
former verſe) <hi>ye are come;</hi> and ſo to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi>
ſtanding on that mount, and <hi>ſprinkling from
thence</hi> his blood: and ſo therein there is an alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> Chriſts Type, who <hi>ſprinkled</hi> the
people <hi>with</hi> the <hi>blood</hi> of that ceremoniall cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the type of the covenant of grace. Now in
the 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 2. The ſprinkling of Chriſt his blood,</hi> as it
is there made the more proper work of Chriſt
himſelfe, in diſtinction from the other perſons,
(and therefore was done by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was his
type) ſo is it alſo put for our <hi>firſt juſtification.</hi> And
this <hi>ſprinkling</hi> (as it is there mentioned) is from the
vertue of his interceſſion: And therefore in that
place of the <hi>Heb.</hi> forecited, he attributes an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
unto it, as the phraſe that follows, <hi>which
[ſpeaks] better things, &amp;c.</hi> doth imply, of which
more hereafter. Yet concerning this firſt Head,
let me adde this by way of caution, (which I ſhall
preſently have occaſion to obſerve) that though
this our firſt juſtification is to be aſcribed to his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſsion,</hi>
yet more eminently <hi>Interceſsion</hi> is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhing our ſalvation, &amp; this other
more rarely in the Scripture attributed thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of our juſtification depends upon it.</note> The <hi>continuation</hi> of our <hi>Iuſtification</hi>
depends upon it. And as his <hi>Interceſsion</hi> is the <hi>vir</hi>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<hi>continuation</hi> of his Sacrifice; ſo is it the <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing</hi>
cauſe of our <hi>juſtification:</hi> which though it be
an act done once, as fully as ever, yet is it done
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:155276:80"/>
over every moment, for it is continued by acts of
<hi>free Grace,</hi> &amp; ſo renewed actually every moment.
There is a <hi>ſtanding in Grace</hi> by Chriſt ſpoken of
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. as well as a firſt <hi>acceſſe by Chriſt,</hi> and that
<hi>ſtanding in grace,</hi> and continuing in it, is afterwards
<hi>ver.</hi> 11. attributed to his <hi>life,</hi> that is, as it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. his <hi>living ever to intercede.</hi> We
owe our <hi>ſtanding</hi> in grace every moment, to his
<hi>ſitting</hi> in Heaven, and interceding every moment;
There is no freſh act of juſtification goes forth,
but there is a freſh act of interceſſion. And as
though God created the World once for all, yet
every moment he is ſaid to create, every new act
of providence beeing a new creation; ſo likewiſe
to juſtifie continually, through his continuing out
free grace to juſtifie as at firſt; and this Chriſt
doth by continuing his Interceſſion: he continues
<hi>a Prieſt for ever,</hi> and ſo we continue to be juſtifyed
for ever.</p>
                     <p>3.<note place="margin">A full ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thereby for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</note> There is hereby a <hi>full ſecurity given us of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
to be continued for ever.</hi> The <hi>danger</hi> either
muſt lie in <hi>old ſins</hi> comming into <hi>remembrance,</hi> or
elſe from <hi>ſins newly</hi> to be committed. Now firſt,
God hereby takes order,<note place="margin">1. Againſt the remembrance of ſins paſt.</note> that <hi>no old ſins ſhall come
up into remembrance,</hi> to trouble his thoughts, (as in
the old Law, after the Prieſts going into the Holy
of holies, their ſins are ſaid yet to have done, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 3.) and to that end it was that he placed <hi>Chriſt</hi>
as his <hi>Remembrancer</hi> for us, ſo neere him, to take
up his thoughts ſo with his obedience, that our
ſinnes might not come into mind: not that God
needed this help to put himſelf in mind, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:155276:81"/>
for a formality ſake, that things being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
carryed between God and Chriſt for us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a way ſuiting with our apprehenſions,
our faith might be ſtrengthened againſt all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
and feares of after reviving our guilts.
Look therefore, as God ordained the <hi>Rain-bow</hi> in
the heavens, that when he lookt on it, he might
remember his Covenant, never to deſtroy the
world againe by water; ſo he hath ſet Chriſt as
the Rain-bow about his Throne. And look as the
<hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the Lords Supper are appointed
on <hi>earth</hi> to <hi>ſhew forth Chriſts death,</hi> as a Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer
to us; ſo is <hi>Chriſt himſelfe</hi> appointed in
<hi>heaven</hi> to ſhew forth his death really, as a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer</hi>
thereof to his Father; and indeed, the
one is correſpondent to the other: Onely the
Papiſts have perverted the uſe of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
by making it on earth, a <hi>commemorative ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
to <hi>God,</hi> when as it is but a <hi>Remembrancer</hi>
thereof to <hi>men:</hi> and beſides, their Prieſts therein
do take upon themſelves this very office of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
this ſacrifice to God, which is proper one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Chriſt in Heaven; But God when he would
make ſure not to be tempted to remember <hi>our ſins
any more,</hi> nor trouble himſelfe with them, hath
ſet his Chriſt by him to put him in minde of his
ſo pleaſing an offering. So the High-Prieſts going
into the Holy of holies, was <hi>for a memoriall,</hi> and
therein the Type of Chriſt. And this is plainly &amp;
expreſly made the uſe of this execution of his
Prieſtly office in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
having diſcourſed of that <hi>part</hi> of his office (as
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:155276:81"/>
the chiefe thing he aimed at in this Epiſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.
and of the neceſſity of it <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4, and 5. and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie</hi>
of it, in this reſpect, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.) he then ſhews,
how from thence the <hi>new Covenant</hi> of pardon
came to be ſure and ſtedfaſt, that <hi>God will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
our ſins no more, ver.</hi> 12. which he there brings
in as the proper uſe of this Doctrine, and of this
part of his Prieſthood.</p>
                     <p>2.<note place="margin">2. To prevent the accuſing &amp; condemning us by <hi>new ſinne;</hi> for times to come.</note> As by reaſon of interceſſion, God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
not old ſins, ſo likewiſe <hi>he is not provoked by
new.</hi> For though God when he juſtifies us ſhould
forgive all old ſins paſt for ever, ſo as never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them more, yet new ones would break
forth, and he could not but take notice of them:
and ſo, ſo long as <hi>ſinne continues,</hi> there is need of a
<hi>continuing interceſsion.</hi> Therefore for the ſecuring
us in this, it is ſaid, <hi>Rom. 5. 10. That if when we were
enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his
Sonne; much more, being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved
[by his life.</hi>] Where we ſee, that his <hi>Death</hi> is in
ſome more ſpeciall manner ſaid to procure <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation</hi>
at <hi>firſt</hi> for ſinnes of <hi>unregeneracie,</hi> and to
bring us to Chriſt; but then his <hi>life</hi> and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
or <hi>living to intercede,</hi> is ſaid to <hi>keep God
and us friends,</hi> that we may never fall out more.
What <hi>Chriſt</hi> did on <hi>earth,</hi> doth more eſpecially
procure <hi>reconciliation</hi> for <hi>ſinnes</hi> which we doe in
the <hi>ſtate of nature;</hi> ſo as notwithſtanding them,
God reſolves to turne us from that ſtate,<note place="margin">Interceſſion principally intended for ſins after con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verſion.</note> and draw
us to Chriſt: But ſins which we commit <hi>after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi>
(though pardoned alſo by his death) yet
the <hi>pardon</hi> of them is more eſpecially attributed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:155276:82"/>
to his <hi>life and interceſsion,</hi> as a daily preſervative, a
continuall plaiſter (as ſome call it) to heale ſuch
ſinnes. So that it would ſeeme, that God out of
his eternall love doth bring us to Chriſt, and
draws us to him through the beholding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
wrought by his death, and ſo gives
us at firſt converſion, unto Chriſt; and we being
brought to him, he ſprinkles us with his bloud;
and then God ſayes to him, Now doe you look
to them, that they and I fall out no more. And
to that end Chriſt takes our cauſe in hand by
that eternall Prieſthood of his; and from that
time begins more eſpecially to intercede for us.
And thus ſinnes after the ſtate of grace, may be
ſaid more eminently to be taken away by that
part of his Prieſthood, which he now in heaven
performes. That place alſo, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. ſeems
to make this the great end of Interceſſion, [<hi>If any
man ſinne,</hi> (that is, if any of the company of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
to whom alone he wrote) <hi>we have an
Advocate wich the Father:</hi>] ſo as Interceſſion prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
ſerves for ſins to come, or committed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
grace received. Thus alſo in his prayer, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.
which was left as a <hi>patterne</hi> of his Interceſſion in
heaven, he prayes for his Elect as Beleevers, <hi>I
pray for them [that ſhall beleeve] through their word:</hi>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:155276:82"/>
more eminently the work of reconciliation for ſins
before converſion, is attributed to his death; &amp; for
ſins after converſion, to his Interceſſion: Even as

Perſon, and another to another.</p>
                     <p>A third ſort of reaſons why God ordained this
work of <hi>Interceſsion</hi> to accompliſh our ſalvation
by,<note place="margin">3. Sort of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from Chriſt.</note> doe reſpect <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, whoſe <hi>honour</hi> and
glory, and the <hi>perpetuation</hi> of it in our hearts, God
had as well in his eye in the ordering all the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
of our ſalvation, as <hi>much</hi> as his owne, <hi>That
all might honour the Sonne as well as the Father,</hi> as
Chriſt himſelfe ſpeaks. Now therefore for the
maintaining and upholding his glory, and the
commings in thereof, did God ordaine after all
that he had done for us here below, this work of
Interceſſion in heaven, to be added to all the
reſt, for the perfecting of our ſalvation. As</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. That none of Chriſts offices ſhould lye va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</note> it became him, and was for his honour,
that none of his offices ſhould be vacant or lye
idle, and he want employment in them: All <hi>offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
have <hi>work</hi> to accompanie them; and all <hi>work</hi>
hath <hi>honour</hi> (as its reward) to ariſe out of it. And
therefore when he had done all that was to be
done on earth, as appertaining unto the <hi>merit</hi> of
our ſalvation, he appoints this full and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
work in heaven, for the applying and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
us of ſalvation, and that as a Prieſt, by
praying and interceding in the merit of that one
oblation of himſelfe. God would have Chriſt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:155276:83"/>
never to be out of office, nor out of work. And
this very reaſon is more then intimated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.
24, 25. <hi>This man, becauſe he continueth ever, hath an
unchangeable Prieſt-hood,</hi> (or, as <hi>ver.</hi> 21. expounds
it) <hi>for ever.</hi> And the work of his Prieſthood is
interpreted, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. to be <hi>ever to make interceſsion.</hi>
The meaning is, that God would not have him
continue to be a Prieſt in title onely, or in reſpect
onely of a ſervice paſt, and ſo to have onely
the honour of Prieſthood perpetuated to him
out of the <hi>remembrance</hi> of what he <hi>once had done,</hi>
(as great Generals have, even in time of peace,
the glory of ſome great battail fought continued
to them in their titles, or rewards for ever:) But
God would have him have as the renowne of the
old, ſo a perpetuall ſpring of honour by new
work, and employment in that office which he
is continually a doing, ſo to preſerve the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
of his glory ever freſh and greene, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ordained a continuall work for him. And
the ſumme of the Apoſtles reaſoning is this,
That ſeeing <hi>himſelfe</hi> was to be <hi>for ever,</hi> ſo ſhould
his <hi>work</hi> and Prieſthood be, that ſo his honour
might be for ever: So <hi>ver.</hi> 28. concludes it, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated</hi>
or <hi>perfected for evermore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. That Chriſt might have a continual hand in each, and every work of our ſalvation to the laſt.</note> for the ſame reaſon alſo, it became
him that the whole worke of our ſalvation firſt
and laſt, and every part of it, every ſtep and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of accompliſhment of it, ſhould be ſo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as he ſhould continue ſtill to have as great and
continuall a hand in every part, even to the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the top ſtone thereof, as he had in laying the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:155276:83"/>
firſt foundation and corner ſtone thereof. And
this you have expreſſed, <hi>Heb. 12. 2. Looking to Ieſus
the beginner</hi> and <hi>perfecter of our faith.</hi> Two things
had been ſaid of him, as two cauſes of two ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
and we muſt looke to him in both. 1. He
is to be looked at, as <hi>Dying, (enduring the Croſſe</hi>)
as there he is ſet forth. 2. As <hi>ſitting at Gods right
hand,</hi> and <hi>interceding;</hi> (as that whole Epiſtle had
repreſented him.) We are to look at theſe two as
cauſes of a <hi>double effect:</hi> to looke at his <hi>dying,</hi> as
that which is the beginning <hi>of our faith,</hi> (ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Greeke, and the margent of our
tranſlation) and at his <hi>ſitting at Gods right hand,</hi> as
an interceſſor, for the <hi>finiſhing of our faith</hi> thereby;
and ſo of our finall ſalvation. For as <hi>Chriſts
worke</hi> began in his life and death; (which is put
for all his obedience here below) ſo our <hi>firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi>
(as was ſaid) begins by vertue of his
<hi>death</hi> at firſt: and as his worke <hi>ends</hi> in his <hi>interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
and ſitting at God his right hand; ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably
is our <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>ſalvation perfected by it,</hi>
that thus he might be left out in nothing, but be
the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega, the Beginning and the End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
to whom be glory for <hi>ever.</hi> So that wee
are to looke upon our Mediator, CHRIST, as
doing as much <hi>worke</hi> for us in <hi>Heaven</hi> at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
<hi>as</hi> ever hee did on <hi>Earth:</hi> here <hi>ſuffering,</hi>
but there <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>preſenting</hi> his ſufferings.
All his worke was not done, when he had done
here: that worke here was indeede the harder
piece of the two, yet ſoone diſpatched; but his
work in heaven, though ſweeter far, yet lyes on
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:155276:84"/>
his hands for ever: therefore let us leave out
none of theſe in our believing on him.</p>

                     <p>1. From the very intent and ſcope of the
<hi>worke</hi> of interceſſion it ſelfe, and what it is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by God to effect.</p>
                     <p>2. From the end of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who
<hi>lives</hi> in Heaven on purpoſe to <hi>intercede for us.</hi>
Our ſalvation it is both <hi>Finis operis,</hi> the end of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:155276:84"/>
work, and <hi>finis ipſius operantis,</hi> in ſome reſpect the
end of Chriſt himſelfe the interceder; and both
theſe doe lay the greateſt engagement that can
be upon Chriſt to accompliſh our ſalvation
through his interceſſion.</p>
                     <p>1. For the work it ſelf, Interceſſion you have
ſeen is a part of the office of Chriſts Prieſthood, as
well as his dying, and offering himſelfe: now all
the works of Chriſt are &amp; muſt be perfect in their
kind, (even as Gods are, of which ſayes <hi>Moſes,
Deut. 32. 4. His work is perfect</hi>) for otherwiſe he
ſhould not be a perfect Prieſt. Now the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of every work lies in order to its end for which
it is ordained; ſo as that work is perfect that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to ſuch an end as it is ordained for, and that
imperfect, which doth not. Now the immediate
direct end of Chriſts Interceſſion, is the actuall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Beleevers, Elect, and perſons whom he
dyed for. The end of his death is <hi>Adoptio juris,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
a right unto ſalvation; but of Interceſſion,
<hi>procuratio ipſius ſalutis,</hi> the very ſaving us actually,
and putting us in poſſeſſion of Heaven. To this
purpoſe, obſerve how the Scripture ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Chriſts death, <hi>Heb. 9. 12. He entred into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
having obtained Redemption,</hi> or <hi>found</hi> redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is, by way of right, by procuring full
title to it. But of his Interceſſion, it ſayes
(<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.) that by it Chriſt is able <hi>to ſave to
the utmoſt, them that come unto God by him:</hi> that
is, actually to ſave, and put them in poſſeſſion
of happineſſe: that is made the end and ſcope of
Interceſſion there; and that phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>]
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:155276:85"/>
                        <hi>to the utmoſt,</hi> notes out a <hi>ſaving indeed,</hi> a doing it
(not by halves, but) wholly, and throughly, and
<hi>compleatly:</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is to ſave <hi>altogether,</hi> to
give our ſalvation its <hi>laſt</hi> act and complement,
that is the true force of the phraſe, even to <hi>effect</hi>
it, to the laſt of it, all that is to be done about it.
Thus alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9, and 10. <hi>We are juſtified by his
death, but [ſaved</hi>] (namely, compleatly) <hi>by his
life,</hi> (that is,) his <hi>living to intercede.</hi> So that the
very ſalvation of Beleevers is it that is the work
[the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] of Chriſts Interceſſion.</p>
                     <p>Now what ſecurity doth this afford?<note place="margin">What ſecurity this affords.</note> for to be
<hi>ſaved</hi> is more then to be <hi>juſtified;</hi> for it is the actual
poſſeſſing us of heaven. So then, do but grant that
Chriſts <hi>Interceſsion</hi> is as perfect a work in its kind
as Chriſts death is in its kind; and you muſt needs
be ſaved. The perfection of Chriſts death, and the
work thereof, wherein lay it (as on Chriſts part
to be performed) but in this, that he ſhould lay
downe a Ranſome ſufficient to purchaſe ſalvation
for ſuch and ſuch perſons as God would ſave? and
ſo the perfection of it lies in the worth and <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie</hi>
of it, to that end it was ordained for: it being
a perfect ſacrifice in it ſelf, <hi>able</hi> to purchaſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
redemption for us, and to make us <hi>ſalvable</hi>
againſt all ſins and the demerits of them, and
to give us <hi>right</hi> to Heaven: and had it wanted a
graine of this, it had then been imperfect. Now
then anſwerably, for interceſſion, the comfort of
our ſouls is, that the proper work that lies upon
Chriſt therein, is the compleat ſaving thoſe very
perſons, and the <hi>poſſeſsing</hi> them of Heaven, this is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:155276:85"/>
the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the proper worke thereof. To out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
the demerits of our ſins was the perfection of
his death, but to <hi>ſave our ſoules</hi> is the end and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of his Interceſſion; Our <hi>ſins</hi> are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the one, and our <hi>ſoules</hi> of the other. To
that end was interceſſion added to his death, that
we might not have a <hi>right</hi> to Heaven in vaine,
of which we might be diſpoſſeſſed. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon this ground if Chriſt ſhould faile of our
ſouls ſalvation, yea, but of any one degree of glory
(purchaſed by his death to any ſoule) which that
ſoule ſhould want, this work of his would then
want and fal ſhort ſo much of its perfection. That
place in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. ſayes not only that Chriſt will
doe his utmoſt to ſave, but <hi>ſave to the utmoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may ſay,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                        </label> My infidelitie and obſtinacy may

                        </label> but interceſſion undertakes the worke
abſolutely: For Chriſt prays not conditionally in
Heaven, <hi>If men ſhall believe</hi> &amp;c. as we doe here on
earth; nor for propoſitions only, but for perſons;
and therefore he prays to cure that very infidelity.
Now as if a Phyſitian undertakes to cure a mad
man (if he knowes what he doth) he conſiders the
madneſſe of his Patient, and how he will teare
off what is applyed, and refuſe all Phyſick; hee
therefore reſolves to deal with him accordingly,
and ſo to order him as he ſhall not hinder that
help which he is about to afford him; and ſo upon
thoſe tearms he undertakes the cure: even ſo doth
Chriſt when by interceſſion hee undertakes to
ſave us ſinners; he conſiders us what we are, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:155276:86"/>
how it is with us,<note place="margin">For Chriſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſhould not be as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a Prieſt in interceding as he was in dying.</note> what unbeliefe is in us, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
the matter, and ſo to ſave us is the ſcope
and end of this his work, which if he ſhould not
accompliſh, he after all this ſhould not be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Prieſt. It was the fault that God found with
the <hi>Old Prieſt-hood,</hi> that it <hi>made nothing perfect, Heb.</hi>
7. 19. and therefore <hi>ver.</hi> 12. the <hi>Law was changed,</hi>
and the <hi>Prieſthood was changed</hi> together with it, (as
there you have it.) Now in like manner Chriſts
Prieſthood ſhould be imperfect, if it made not the
elect perfect, and then God muſt yet ſeek for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Covenant, and a more perfect Prieſt; for this
would be found faulty, as the other was. So then
our comfort is, if Chriſt approve himſelfe to be
a <hi>perfect Prieſt,</hi> we <hi>who come to God by him</hi> muſt be
perfectly ſaved. It is in this office of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and all the parts of it, as in his Kingly
office: The worke of his Kingly office is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
all enemies, to the laſt man, even fully to do
the thing; and not onely to have power, and to
goe about to doe it: ſo as if there ſhould be any
one enemie left unſubdued, then Chriſt ſhould
not be a perfect King. The ſame holds in his
Prieſtly office alſo; he ſhould not be a perfect
Prieſt, if but one ſoule of the elect, or thoſe he
intercedes for, were left unſaved. And this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the top and higheſt conſideration for our
comfort in this argument, that Interceſſion leaves
us not till it hath actually and compleatly ſaved
us; and this is it that makes the Apoſtle put a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing upon Interceſſion here in the Text, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
upon that other his <hi>ſitting at Gods right hand.</hi> So as
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:155276:86"/>
we are in this reſpect as ſure of attaining unto the
utmoſt glory of our ſalvation, as Chriſt to have
the full honour of his Prieſthood. A man ſaved is
more then juſtifyed; and Chriſt cannot reckon his
work, nor himſelfe a perfect Prieſt, untill we are
ſaved. <hi>Who ſhall condemne? it is Chriſt that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> the conſideration of the nature and

honour of acquiting himſelfe as a <hi>perfect Prieſt,</hi>
hath undertaken; There is in the ſecond place a
farther conſideration that argues him engaged by
a ſtronger obligation,<note place="margin">His honour engaged to effect.</note> even the loſſe of his owne
honour, his office and all, if he ſhould not effect
ſalvation for thoſe that come to God by him; ſo
much doth it concern him to effect it. Of all the
works that ever he did, he is moſt engaged in this;
it will not only be <hi>the loſſe of a buſineſſe</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
him, and of ſo much work, but <hi>himſelfe</hi> muſt
be <hi>loſt</hi> in it too: And the reaſon is, that he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
as a <hi>Surety.</hi> He was not onely a <hi>Surety on
earth</hi> in dying, (and ſo was to look to do that work
throughly,<note place="margin">That Chriſt is a <hi>Surety</hi> as wel by <hi>interceding,</hi> as by <hi>dying.</hi>
                        </note> and to be ſure to lay downe a price
ſufficient, or elſe himſelfe had gone for it: hee
pawned in that work, not onely his honour, but
even his life and ſoule to effect it, or loſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in it) but he is a <hi>Surety</hi> now alſo in heaven,
<hi>by interceding.</hi> This you may find to be the ſcope
of <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. by obſerving the coherence of that
22. <hi>ver.</hi> (wherein he is called a <hi>Surety</hi>) with <hi>ver.</hi>
23, 24, 25. that title and appellation is there gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, in relation unto this part of his office
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:155276:87"/>
eſpecially. And although it holds true of all parts
of his office whatſoever; yet the coherence car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
it, that <hi>that</hi> mention there of his being a <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
doth in a more ſpecial manner, refer unto his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,
as appeares both by the words before,
&amp; after: In the words before, (<hi>ver.</hi> 21.) the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeaks of this his <hi>Prieſt-hood which is for ever,</hi>
and then ſubjoynes, (<hi>ver.</hi> 22.) <hi>By ſo much was
Ieſus made a Surety of a better Teſtament:</hi> and then
after alſo he diſcourſeth of, and inſtanceth in his
Interceſſion, and his continuing a Prieſt for ever
in that work: So <hi>ver. 23, 24, 25. Wherefore he is able
to ſave to the utmoſt, ſeeing he ever lives to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſsion:</hi>
Yea, he is therefore engaged to ſave
to the utmoſt, becauſe even in <hi>interceding</hi> (for
which he is ſaid there to live) he is a Surety.</p>
                     <p>He was a Surety on earth, and is a Surety ſtill
in heaven;<note place="margin">The difference of theſe two Suretiſhips.</note> onely with this double difference,
which ariſeth firſt from the different things
which he undertook for then, whilſt on earth,
and for which now he undertakes in heaven:
That on earth he was a Surety to <hi>pay a price</hi>
ſo ſufficient, as ſhould ſatisfie Gods juſtice; which
having paid, he was diſcharged (in that reſpect,
and ſo far) of that Obligation, and his Bond for
that was cancelled, but ſo as ſtill he remaines a
Surety, bound in another Obligation as great,
even for the bringing to ſalvation thoſe whom
he dyed for; for their perſons remained ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaved,
though the debt was then paid: and till
they be ſaved, he is not quit of this Surety-ſhip
and engagement. And ſecondly, theſe two
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:155276:87"/>
Surety-ſhips doe differ alſo by the differing <hi>Pawns</hi>
which he was engaged to forfeit, by failing in
each of theſe works: for the payment of our
debt, his <hi>ſoule</hi> it ſelfe lay at the ſtake, which
he offered up for ſin; but for the ſaving of the
perſons, all his honour in heaven lies at ſtake:
<hi>He lives to intercede;</hi> He poſſeſſeth Heaven upon
theſe tearms, and it is one end of his life; ſo
that as he muſt have ſunk under Gods wrath if he
had not paid the debt, (his ſoule ſtanding in our
ſouls ſtead) ſo he muſt yet quit heaven, and give
over living there, if he brings us not thither. It
is true, he intercedes not as a <hi>Common perſon,</hi>
(which relation in all other forementioned acts
he ſtill bore; thus in his death he was both a
Common perſon, and a Surety repreſenting us,
ſo as we died in him; ſo likewiſe in his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
we aroſe with him, and in his Aſcenſion
we aſcended, &amp;c. but yet he intercedes not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that relation, namely, not as a Common
perſon;) for we muſt not, cannot be ſaid to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
in him, for this laſt work lay not upon us to
doe. He doth it wholly for us indeed, but not in
our ſtead, or as that which we ſhould have done,
though on our behalfe; for it being the laſt, the
crowne of all his works of mediation, is therefore
proper to him as Mediator, and his ſole work as
ſuch. Thus in like manner the firſt work of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,
and anſwerably the laſt of Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in neither of theſe was Chriſt a Common
perſon repreſenting others, though a common
Saviour of others in theſe; for the one was the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:155276:88"/>
foundation of all, the other the accompliſhment
of all, and ſo proper onely to himſelfe, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.
But although he intercedes not as a
Common perſon, as repreſenting us in what we
were to have done for our ſelves, yet ſo as that
other relation of a <hi>Surety</hi> is continued ſtill in that
work; he ſtands engaged therein as an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
for us, and ſo as a <hi>Surety, intercedes:</hi> Such
as <hi>Iudah</hi> was for <hi>Benjamin, Gen. 43. 9. I will be
ſurety for him; of my hand ſhalt thou require him:
if I bring him not unto thee, and ſet him before
thee, then let me beare the blame for ever:</hi> So ſayes
Chriſt for us. And therefore <hi>Sponſio,</hi> or <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking</hi>
for us, is by Divines made a great part
of this part of his office. Now the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this may the more ſecure us; for the
more peculiarly and ſolely it is his work, the more
his honour lies at ſtake, and the more he will
ſet himſelfe to effect it; yea, and being by way
of <hi>Suretiſhip,</hi> it concerns him yet more neerly, for
he hath engaged, (and if he ſhould faile,) might
even loſe that honour which he hath now in
heaven.</p>

                     <p>Now firſt for the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of Chriſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor,<note place="margin">1. From the greatneſſe of Chriſts perſon, and his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God who intercedes.</note>
that is, his <hi>greatneſſe with God</hi> the
Father. This is often urged in this Epiſtle to the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> to perſwade confidence in us, in this
very point in hand: thus <hi>Heb. 4. 14, 16. Seeing
we have a [great] High-prieſt, let us come boldly:</hi>
And whilſt <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Prieſt</hi> are thus joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the more comfort and boldneſſe wee may
have, the greater he is: For he is a <hi>Prieſt</hi> in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his dealing with God for our pardon; as
he is a Prieſt, he deales in nothing elſe; and the
greater the perſon is, who uſeth his intereſt herein,
the better, the ſooner he will prevaile. And he
is there ſaid to be <hi>Great,</hi> becauſe great with God,
in prevailing with him; and indeed ſo great, as it
is impoſſible but he ſhould prevaile. It was the
greatneſſe of his perſon, which did and doth put
ſuch an influence into his death, that it was (as
you heard) a <hi>price,</hi> more then enough, to ſatisfie
Juſtice, even to overflowing: And therefore <hi>Who
ſhall condemne? It is Chriſt that dyed.</hi> And the
greatneſſe of his perſon muſt needs have as much
influence to make Interceſſion prevalent. In a
matter of interceſſion, the perſon that intercedes
prevailes more then any other conſideration
whatſoever. We ſee what great friends doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
oftentimes with but a word ſpeaking, even
that which money, no nor any thing elſe could
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:155276:90"/>
have obtained.<note place="margin">Demonſtrated by three things:</note> Now Chriſt muſt needs be great
with God in many reſpects.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. The neernes of his alliance, that he is <hi>Gods naturall Son.</hi>
                        </note> in reſpect of the neerneſſe of his alliance to
him, He is the <hi>naturall</hi> Son of God, God of God,
and therefore certaine to prevaile with him. This
is diligently ſtill put in, almoſt in all places, where
this part of his Prieſt-hood (his Interceſſion) is
mentioned, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Heb.</hi> So in the 4. of
the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>ver. 14. We have a great High-prieſt
entred into the heavens, Ieſus, [the Son of God.</hi>] So
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. and 28. <hi>ver.</hi> compared, the Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. that <hi>He is able to ſave to the utmoſt,
ſeeing he ever lives to make Interceſsion</hi>) he doth <hi>ver.</hi>
28. devolve this ability of his to ſave (ultimately)
upon his being the <hi>Sonne:</hi> thus in the 28. <hi>verſe,</hi>
in the end of that diſcourſe, this is made as the
Baſis of all: [<hi>The Law (ſaith he) makes men High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts
which have infirmity</hi>] (which infirmity or
diſability of theirs, is mentioned in oppoſition
unto what he had juſt before ſpoken of the great
<hi>ability</hi> of his our High-prieſt in his interceding,
<hi>ver.</hi> 25. in thoſe words, <hi>He is [able] to ſave to
the utmoſt.</hi>) Thoſe Prieſts whom the ceremoniall
Law made, (<hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes) are unable to
ſave, they have infirmity: Now what is it in
him that makes this difference, and him ſo able
above what they were? <hi>The word of the Oath makes
the [Son</hi>] (ſayes he) <hi>who is perfected</hi> (as you have
it in the Greeke, and margent) <hi>for evermore.</hi> He
mentions this his Son-ſhip principally in relation
to his Interceſſion, which there he had diſcourſed
of. Interceſſion is a carrying on our ſalvation in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:155276:91"/>
a way of grace and favour, as his <hi>death</hi> was by
way of <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How great an influence this hath into In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion to make it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</note> And anſwerably it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in the Scripture, that as the <hi>all-ſufficiencie</hi>
of the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of his <hi>death,</hi> is ſtill put upon his
being <hi>God;</hi> and ſo upon the <hi>greatneſſe of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
conſidered in <hi>reſpect of his nature</hi> or <hi>eſſence,</hi>
namely, his <hi>God-head:</hi> So in like manner, that the
<hi>prevalencie</hi> of his <hi>Interceſsion</hi> is founded upon the
<hi>neerneſſe</hi> of his <hi>relation</hi> unto God, his <hi>allyance</hi> to
him, and the <hi>being</hi> his <hi>Sonne.</hi> Thus for the firſt.
When <hi>Redemption</hi> is ſpoken of, the <hi>ſufficiencie</hi> of
the <hi>price</hi> is eminently put upon his <hi>God-head, [The
bloud of God.</hi>] Thus alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. where when he
had (<hi>ver.</hi> 12.) ſhewne how Chriſt had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and obtained a <hi>perfect redemption,</hi> he then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
the ſufficiencie of it from his <hi>God-head,
ver. 13, 14. For if the bloud of Bulls and of Goats,
and the aſhes of an Heifer, ſprinkling the uncleane,
ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh: How much
more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who [through the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ſpirit] offered himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>eternall ſpirit</hi> is
his <hi>God-head.</hi> Thus anſwerably when he ſpeaks
of the prevailing of his Interceſſion in Heaven,
he puts it upon his <hi>Sonne-ſhip [Ieſus the Sonne,</hi>] he
mentions the neerneſſe of the relation of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to God, as being that which draws with it
that great reſpect of favour &amp; grace, he being by
this great with God, as great in himſelf. All
matters of Interceſſion are carried we know by
way of favour: And therefore looke how preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in a way of merit, his being <hi>God</hi> makes his
<hi>death</hi> in its kinde; no leſſe prevalent doth his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:155276:91"/>
the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> make his <hi>Interceſsion</hi> in its
kinde, namely, in a way of obtaining grace and
mercie: yea ſo prevalent of it ſelfe it is, that we
might build upon it alone, even as much as upon
his death. And indeed, Chriſt intercedes not
only in the vertue and ſtrength of his ſatisfaction,
(though in that alſo) and of his obedience to his
Father: but alſo in the ſtrength of his relation as
<hi>a Sonne</hi> who pleads his own grace and intereſt in
God, as he is his Sonne; which is a conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that doth always <hi>actually</hi> exiſt and abide:
Whereas his obedience (though perfect) was
but once <hi>offered up,</hi> and its exiſtence is but <hi>virtuall;</hi>
but he continues <hi>a Sonne for ever,</hi> not virtually
only, but actually. And therefore it is added
in that ſeventh to the <hi>Hebrews, ver. laſt,</hi> that the
<hi>Goſpell ordained the Sonne [perfected for ever.</hi>] The
meaning whereof is, that he is not only a Prieſt
perfected in the time paſt by that perfect offering
once made, but in that he is the Sonne, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
a <hi>perfect Prieſt for ever,</hi> for time to come:
whom therefore no imperfection in his office,
no failing or miſſing of his ſuits can befall. So as
if it could be ſuppoſed that his obedience (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
paſt ſo long ago) might be forgotten: yet
never this, that he is a <hi>Sonne:</hi> That for ever abides,
and of it ſelfe were enough to prevaile. And how
effectuall muſt the interceſſion of ſuch a Son be,
who is ſo great a Sonne of ſo great a Father, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
with him, and the expreſſe Image of his
Perſon? never any Sonne ſo like, and in ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
a tranſcendent manner a Sonne, as the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:155276:92"/>
relation of Sonne-ſhip among men is but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of it! Chriſt is <hi>one</hi> with his Father, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
often ſpeakes; and therefore if his Father
ſhould deny him any thing, he ſhould then ceaſe
to be one with him, he muſt then <hi>deny himſelfe,</hi>
which God can never do. He is in this reſpect
[<hi>the Beloved</hi>] as he is called, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6. as on
whom (originally and primarily) all the beames
of Gods love doe fall. <hi>Solomon</hi> (the type of
Chriſt) was <hi>the beloved of God, 2 Sam.</hi> 12. 24.
and had his name from thence, (namely) <hi>Iedidiah,</hi>
that is, <hi>beloved of the Lord:</hi> And to ſhew how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
he was, God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came firſt to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
bade him <hi>ask what he ſhould give him, 1 King.</hi>
3. 5. Now the like God ſayes to Chriſt when come
firſt to his Kingdome alſo, <hi>Pſal. 2. 8. Ask of me and I
will give thee;</hi> namely, when <hi>he had ſet him as King on
his holy hill, ver.</hi> 6. And of him he ſayes, <hi>This is my
well-beloved Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed, heare
him.</hi> God bids us therefore and upon that reſpect
to <hi>heare him;</hi> and that ſpeech was but the eccho
of his own heart, in that he himſelfe is ſo well
pleaſed with him for this that he is his Sonne, as
he himſelfe will heare him in every thing, yea,
and is ſo pleaſed with him, as that although Chriſt
had never died, nor obeyed the Law; yet ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
becauſe he is his Sonne, he hath ſo full an
acquieſcencie of all deſires in him, and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
of delights, that he could deny him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
How prevalent then muſt Chriſts inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
needes be, though there were nothing
elſe to be conſidered?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:155276:92"/>
And that God had indeed this as one maine
conſideration,<note place="margin">That God had this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Sonne,</hi> when he ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, as that which would fit him for this work.</note> upon which he made him a Prieſt
thus to intercede, thoſe words doe teſtifie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.
5, and 6. <hi>He that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Sonne,
this day have I begotten thee; As he ſaith alſo in another
place, Thou art a Prieſt for ever, after the order of
Melchiſedech:</hi> Theſe latter words are not onely a
Paraphraſe (as ſome think) meerly to ſhew
that [<hi>He] that ſaid, Chriſt was his Sonne,</hi> ſaid alſo,
<hi>He was a Prieſt;</hi> but it is to ſhew the foundation
of his call to that office. The great conſideration
that fitted him for it, was, that he was Gods
Sonne; eſpecially that fitted him for that part
of his Prieſt-hood, which was to remain <hi>for ever,</hi>
(of which that 110. <hi>Pſal.</hi> and the Epiſtle to the
<hi>Heb.</hi> doe eſpecially ſpeak.) Neither is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the fore-cited place onely to ſhew that in
that he was Gods Sonne, it was his birth-right
to be a Prieſt: ſo as if God would have any Prieſt
at all, it muſt be he: And ſo upon that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
he that ſaid to him, <hi>Thou art my Sonne,</hi>
ſaid, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt;</hi> and that being his right, he
therefore called him to it, becauſe he was <hi>his
Sonne,</hi> (for according to the Law of Nature, the
eldeſt in the family was to be Prieſt; and ſo
Chriſt, even as God-man, being <hi>the firſt-borne
of every creature,</hi> and the naturall firſt begotten
Sonne of God, had right to be the prime leader
of that great <hi>Chorus</hi> in that eternall worſhip in
heaven:) That (I ſay) is not all the meaning of
thoſe words, nor all that God conſidered in it,
when he thus ordained him to be a Prieſt; but
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:155276:93"/>
he had a further and more peculiar reſpect unto
this eſpeciall part of his Prieſthood, his <hi>Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
(as that clauſe <hi>for ever</hi> imports) as for which,
he being his naturall Son, ſo neerly allyed to him,
would tranſcendtly fit him, and give ſuch an
omnipotent prevalencie and effectualneſſe to his
requeſts, that he would be the moſt abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Prieſt for ever, (in this reſpect) that could be:
That as God himſelfe is perfect, and his power
irreſiſtible, ſo his Prieſthood through this relation
might be perfect alſo, and his requeſts undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Thus did God order it to ſtrengthen our
faith. And that indeed God did conſider this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his to him to this very end is evident by
that of the 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> (out of which that ſaying [<hi>Thou
art my Son</hi>] is cited) <hi>ver.</hi> 7, and 8. <hi>Thou art my Son, this
day have I begotten thee;</hi> and what follows? <hi>Ask of
me and I will give thee, &amp;c.</hi> He connects both theſe
together, namely, interceſſion, (that part of his
Prieſtly office of asking) with his Son-ſhip, for
that is it which moveth God to grant all that he
asks. God loves Chriſt as he loves himſelfe, and
therefore can deny him nothing, as he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
himſelfe. And ſo by the way, this clears the
ground of the Apoſtles quoting thoſe words of
the 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> in the 5. to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> as a proofe of
Chriſts call to the Prieſthood, which Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have been troubled how to make out; for (as
you have ſeene) that ſpeech [<hi>Thou art my Son, ask,
&amp;c.</hi>] is all one as if he had ſaid, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt;</hi>
and ſo was as fit and full a place to prove his
being a Prieſt in the holy Ghoſts intent, as is
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:155276:93"/>
that other quoted with it, out of the 110. <hi>Pſal.</hi>
though uttered in more expreſſe words, <hi>Thou art a
Prieſt for ever:</hi> Both ſpeeches come to one, in
both places; the holy Ghoſt eſpecially aiming
in both at that part of his Prieſthood in heaven,
his Interceſſion; in the one ſpeaking of him <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he is ſet upon Gods hill,</hi> as <hi>King:</hi> (So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.
<hi>ver.</hi> 6.) and in the other, <hi>after he is ſet downe
at Gods right hand:</hi> (So <hi>Pſal. 110. ver.</hi> 1, 2.) Yea,
and this his favour with his Father, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
alone, might have procured pardon for
us ſinners, but that Gods will was to have Juſtice
ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly,<note place="margin">2 His potency with God, from his having been ſo <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent a Sonne.</hi>
                        </note> hee intercedes not onely
as a Sonne, (and in that reſpect a Prieſt perfect
enough for ever) but alſo as a <hi>Sonne</hi> who hath
beene <hi>obedient</hi> to his Father, and hath done at his
requeſt, and for his ſake, the greateſt ſervice
for him, and the moſt willingly that ever was
done: And you all know how much former ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
done, doe always forward ſuits. In the
5. of the <hi>Heb. ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10. it is ſaid, that <hi>though
he were a Son, yet learned he obedience,</hi> and thereby
<hi>became perfect.</hi> The Apoſtle had ſaid in the verſes
before, that in reſpect of his being his Son, God
had called him to this office, as one that was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſufficiently qualifyed to be a Prieſt that might
prevaile; and yet in theſe verſes he further adds,
that though he was a Son, (and in that reſpect a
Prieſt perfect enough) yet he was to bee <hi>obedient</hi>
alſo, and thereby yet to become in a further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
a perfect Highprieſt alſo, even in reſpect of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:155276:94"/>
ſervice done, and obedience performed. And ſo
ſhews that he coms to have a further perfection &amp;
power of prevailing in his prieſtly office added to
that relation of Sonne-ſhip, ſpoken of <hi>ver.</hi> 5. And
therefore it followes, that he <hi>being thus become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
namely, through his obedience, <hi>he became
Author of eternall ſalvation unto all them that obey
him, called of God an High-prieſt for ever, &amp;c.</hi>
That therefore which makes him yet more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
(that he may be ſure to prevaile) is his
obedience, and ſervice done; and this alone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
were enough to carry any thing. And both
theſe conſiderations of his Sonne-ſhip and
obedience, as giving an efficacie to his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
you have alſo in that <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. from <hi>ver.</hi> 26.
to 28. he had ſpoken of the power of Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>ver.</hi> 24, 25. how he was <hi>able to ſave to the
utmoſt;</hi> and then in the following <hi>verſes</hi> he ſhews
the ground of it, firſt in his fore-paſt <hi>obedience,
ver. 26. 1. Active, For ſuch a High-prieſt became us,
who was [holy, harmleſſe, undefiled.</hi>] And ſuch a
Prieſt he was, and therefore able thus to ſave by
his Interceſſion: For ſuch an one who was holy,
harmleſſe, and no guile found in <hi>his mouth,</hi> what
requeſts come out of ſuch lips, muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
Then 2. he mentions his <hi>Paſsive obedience,
ver. 27. He offered up himſelfe once,</hi> and thereby
made ſo full a ſatisfaction, as he needed not to
doe it but once; and in the ſtrength of both theſe
he intercedes: for to that purpoſe doth the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of both theſe there come in. And then he
addes that other which we before inſiſted on,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:155276:94"/>
that he is <hi>the Sonne,</hi> which follows in the next
words, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. And accordingly you ſhall
finde Chriſt himſelfe urging this his obedience,
as the foundation of all thoſe his ſuits and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
for us that follow after. So in that laſt
prayer, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. (which is as it were a pattern
or inſtance of his Interceſſion for us in Heaven)
<hi>I have glorifyed thee on earth, I have finiſhed the
worke thou gaveſt me:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Two things to be diſtinctly conſidered in his obedience, and both ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with God.</note> 
                        <hi>ver.</hi> 4. And whereas two
things may be diſtinctly conſidered, in that his
<hi>obedience.</hi> 1. The <hi>worth</hi> of it, as a <hi>price</hi> in the valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of <hi>Iuſtice</hi> it ſelfe; 2. The <hi>deſert</hi> of <hi>favour</hi>
and grace with God; which ſuch an obedience
and ſervice done for his ſake, might in a way of
kindneſſe expect to finde at his hands: you may
for your comfort conſider, that beſides what
the worth of it as a price, which I ſhall urge in the
next Chapter, might exact of Juſtice it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two ſtrangers (as we uſe to ſay) he having
well paid for all that he asks; he hath moreover
deſerved thus much grace and favour with his
Father, in that this obedience was done for his
ſake and at his requeſt; and this it calls for even in
way of remuneration and requitall as of one kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
with the like: That therefore his Father ſhould
heare him in all the requeſts that ever he ſhould
make, yea ſo tranſcendent was the obedience
which he did to his Father, in giving himſelfe
to death at his requeſt, (and it was done at
Gods ſole entreaty, <hi>Loe I come to doe thy will</hi>) as
he can never out-aske the merit of this his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
And (which may yet further encourage us
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:155276:95"/>
herein) he hath nothing at all left to aske for
himſelfe ſimply, for he hath need of nothing. So
that all his favour remaines entire, for to be laid
forth for ſinners, and employed for them: and
then adde this thereto, that all he can aske for
them, is leſſe, yea farre leſſe then the ſervice
which he hath done to God comes to; our
lives, and pardon, and ſalvation, theſe are not
enough; they are too ſmall a requitall. So that
beſides his <hi>naturall</hi> grace, and intereſt which
he hath with his Father, as hee is his Sonne,
(which can never be leſſened) this his <hi>acquired</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
by his <hi>obedience</hi> muſt needs make him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
ſeeing it can never be requited to the full.
Some Divines put ſo much efficacie in this, that
they ſay, Chriſts very being in Heaven, who once
did this ſervice, and ſo putting God in minde of it
by his very preſence, is all that interceſſion, that
the Scripture ſpeakes of; ſo ſufficient they thinke
this alone to be.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, eſpecially when Chriſt himſelfe
ſhall joyne with that cry and <hi>Interceſsion</hi> of his
blood, himſelfe in Heaven appearing and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
in the ſtrength of it.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt,<note place="margin">1. How an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion and appeale to Gods juſtice is attributed to Chriſts bloud.</note> the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. doth
aſcribe a voice, an appeal, an <hi>Interceſsion</hi> unto the
bloud of Chriſt in Heaven. <hi>The blood of ſprinkling</hi>
(ſayes he) [<hi>ſpeakes] better things then the blood of
Abel.</hi> He makes Chriſts very bloud an Advocate
to <hi>ſpeak</hi> for us, though Chriſt himſelfe were ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
as he ſayes in another caſe, <hi>Abel, though
dead, yet ſpeaketh, Heb.</hi> 11. 4. Many other things
are ſaid to <hi>cry</hi> to Scripture, (and I might ſhew
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:155276:96"/>
how the cry of all other things doe meet in
this) but Bloud hath the loudeſt cry of all
things elſe, in the eares of the Lord of Hoſts,
the <hi>Iudge</hi> of all the world, as he is in the 23.
<hi>ver.</hi> of that 12. <hi>Chap.</hi> ſtyled. Neither hath any
<hi>cry</hi> the eare of Gods juſtice more then that of
<hi>bloud; The voyce of thy brothers bloud</hi> (ſayes God
to <hi>Cain) cryes unto me from the ground, Gen.</hi> 4. 10.
Now in that ſpeech of the Apoſtle forecited,
is the alluſion made unto the bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> and
the cry thereof: And he illuſtrates the cry of
Chriſts bloud <hi>for us,</hi> by the cry of that bloud of
<hi>Abel againſt Cain,</hi> it <hi>ſpeaks better things then the
bloud of Abel:</hi> And his ſcope therein is by an
<hi>Antitheſis</hi> or way of oppoſition, to ſhew, that
Chriſts <hi>blood</hi> cals for <hi>greater good</hi> things to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on us <hi>for whom</hi> it was ſhed, then <hi>Abels</hi>
bloud did for <hi>evill</hi> things, and vengeance againſt
<hi>Cain, by whom</hi> it was ſhed. For look how loud
the bloud of one innocent cryes for juſtice againſt
another that murdered him; ſo loud will the
bloud of one righteous (who by the appointment
and permiſſion of a ſupreame Judge, hath been
condemned for another) cry for his releaſe and
non-condemnation, for whom he dyed. And the
more righteous he was, who laid downe his life
for another, the louder ſtill is that cry, for it is
made in the ſtrength of all that worth which was
in him, whoſe bloud was ſhed. Now to ſet forth
the power of this cry of Chriſts bloud with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
let us compare it with that cry of <hi>Abels</hi>
bloud in theſe two things, wherein it will be
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:155276:97"/>
found infinitely to exceed it in force and
loudneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">This cry of his bloud, illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with the cry of the bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> in all which it exceeds it.</note> even the bloud of the wickedeſt man on
earth, if innocently ſhed, doth cry, and hath a
power with Juſtice againſt him who murdered
him. Had <hi>Abel</hi> murdered <hi>Cain, Cains</hi> bloud would
have cryed, and called upon Gods Juſtice againſt
<hi>Abel:</hi> but [<hi>Abels bloud</hi>] (there is an emphaſis in
that) <hi>Abels,</hi> who was a Saint, and the firſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
in Gods Kalender; and ſo his bloud cryes
according to the worth that was in him. Now
<hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his
Saints;</hi> and the bloud of one of Them cryes
louder then the bloud of all Man-kind beſides.
Now from this I argue, If the bloud of a Saint
cryes ſo, what muſt the bloud of the <hi>King of
Saints</hi> (as Chriſt is called, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.) then doe?
If the blood of one member of Chriſts body,
what will then the blood of the head, far more
worth then that whole body? how doth it fill
Heaven and Earth with out-cries, untill the
promiſed intent of its ſhedding be accompliſht?
And (as the Antitheſis carries it) looke how the
blood of <hi>Abel</hi> cryed for the ruine and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of his brother <hi>Cain,</hi> ſo does Chriſts blood
on the contrary for our pardon and non-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
and ſo much the lowder, by how much
his blood was of more worth then <hi>Abels</hi> was.
This was the <hi>blood of God;</hi> ſo <hi>Act. 20. Who therefore
ſhall condemne?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But 2. <hi>Chriſts</hi> blood hath in its crie here a further
advantage of <hi>Abels blood</hi> attributed to it: For that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:155276:97"/>
cryed but from earth, <hi>from the ground,</hi> where it lay
ſhed, and that but for an anſwerable earthly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
on <hi>Cain,</hi> as he was a man upon the earth;
but Chriſts blood is carried up to Heaven: for as
the High-prieſt carried the blood of the Sacrifices
into the Holy of holies, ſo hath Chriſt virtually
carried his blood into Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. And
this is intimated in this place alſo, as by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
will appeare. For all the other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
(of which this is one) whereto he ſayes the
Saints are come, they are all in Heaven: <hi>You
are come</hi> (ſaies he <hi>ver.</hi> 22) <hi>to the City of the living
God, the Heavenly Hieruſalem, and to an innumerable
company of Angels, to the Church of the firſt borne
who are written in Heaven, and to God the Iudge of all,
and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect:</hi> All which
things are in Heaven; neither names he any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then ſuch: And then adds [<hi>And to the blood
of ſprinkling which ſpeakes, &amp;c.</hi>] as a thing both
ſpeaking in Heaven, and beſprinkled from
Heaven, yea, wherewith Heaven is all beſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as the Mercie-ſeat in the Holy of holies was,
becauſe ſinners are to come thither. This Blood
therefore cries from Heaven, it is next unto
God who ſits Judge there, it cries in his very
eares; whereas the cry of blood from the ground
is further off, and ſo though the cry thereof may
come up to Heaven, yet the blood it ſelfe comes
not up thither, as Chriſts already is. <hi>Abels</hi> blood
cryed for vengeance to come down from heaven,
but Chriſts blood cries us up into Heaven: like
to that voice <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 12. [<hi>Come up hither:</hi>] So
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:155276:98"/>
                        <hi>Iohn 17. 24. Where I am, let them be,</hi> for whom this
blood was ſhed.</p>
                     <p>But though this ſpeaking,<note place="margin">An explication in what ſenſe Chriſts blood is ſaid to cry.</note> this voice, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
be attributed to his blood, yet it is but
in a Metaphoricall and improper (though reall)
ſenſe: as alſo that this blood is in Heaven, is
ſpoken, though in a reall, yet not a proper ſenſe.
Some Divines of all ſides, both Popiſh and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
would make the whole work of Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to be onely <hi>Metaphoricall.</hi> It is true indeede,
the voice and interceſſion of his blood apart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
is but Metaphoricall, (I grant) and yet
reall; ſuch a voice as thoſe <hi>groanes</hi> are that are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the <hi>whole creation, Rom.</hi> 8. 22. But
Interceſſion as an act of Chriſt himſelfe, joyned
with this voice of his blood, is moſt properly and
truly ſuch.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in the ſecond place,<note place="margin">2. Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe living &amp; joyning with the cry of his bloud, how prevalent it muſt needs be.</note> adde to this
<hi>Chriſts</hi> own interceſſion alſo, which was the ſecond
thing propounded, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his own Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſeconds this cry of his blood: that not only the
blood of Chriſt doth cry, but that Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
being alive doth joyne with it: how
forcible and prevalent muſt all this be ſuppoſed
to be? The blood of a man ſlain doth cry, though
the man remain dead; even as of <hi>Abel</hi> it is ſaid,
(though to another purpoſe) <hi>that being dead he
yet ſpeaketh, Heb.</hi> 11. but Chriſt liveth and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:
<hi>Vivit, &amp; in coelum coelorum venit;</hi> He follows
the ſuit, purſues the Hue and cry of his blood
himſelfe. His being alive, puts a life into his death.
It is not in this as it was in that other, the firſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:155276:98"/>
                        <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne and diſobedience. <hi>Adam</hi> although
he himſelfe had beene annihilated when he dyed,
yet he having ſet the ſtock of our nature a going
in propagation of Children, his ſin would have
defiled and condemned them to the end of the
world, and the force of it to condemne is neither
furthered nor leſſened by his ſubſiſting &amp; being,
or his not being: it receives no aſſiſtance from
his perſonall life, one way or other. And the
reaſon is, becauſe his ſinne condemnes us in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <hi>turall</hi>
and <hi>neceſſary</hi> way: But the death of Chriſt
and his blood ſhed, theſe ſaving us in a way of
<hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> unto Chriſt himſelfe and for his
ſake, that very being alive of Chriſt, <hi>that</hi> ſhed
this blood, adds an infinite acceptation to it with
God, and moves him the more to hear the cry of
it, and to regard it. In a matter of favour to be
done for the ſake of another man, or in a ſuit or
matter of juſtice that concerns another, who is
intereſted in it, that mans being <hi>in vivis,</hi> his being
alive, puts a life into the cauſe. If <hi>David</hi> would
have reſpect to <hi>Ionathan</hi> (when dead) in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
he would much more if himſelfe had been
alive. God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham,
Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> to remember their Seed after
them; And why? They are alive, and were to
live for ever; and though dead, ſhall riſe againe.
So <hi>Chriſt</hi> reaſoneth from it, <hi>Mat. 22. 32. I am the God
of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob: <hi>God is the God of
the living,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and not of the dead:</hi> and ſo,
<hi>though</hi> Abraham <hi>be ignorant of his children</hi> (as the
prophet ſpeakes) and ſhould not intercede for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:155276:99"/>
them, yet becauſe <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſoul lives, and is not
extinct, (as the Sadduces thought) but ſhall live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at the Reſurrection; therefore God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and reſpects his covenant with them; for he
is a God of the living, and ſo his Covenant holds
with them whilſt they live. The old covenant of
the firſt Teſtament ran in the names of <hi>Abraham,
Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob, [The God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob</hi>]
but this new covenant runs in the name of Chriſt,
<hi>The God and Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> ſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.
3. and ſo he becomes our God and our Father in
him. And God being thus our Father, becauſe
Chriſts Father, and Chriſt (in whoſe name the
Covenant runs) being <hi>alive,</hi> and God by Covenant
the God of a living, not of a dead Chriſt; This
therefore works effectually with him to reſpect
his blood and hear the cry of it; and this, though
Chriſt were abſent, much more then when he
is preſent alſo, and on purpoſe <hi>appeareth in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God for us;</hi> as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. He is alive,
and ſo, able to follow his owne ſuit, and will be
ſure to ſee to it, and to ſecond the cry of his blood,
if it ſhould not be heard.</p>
                     <p>To illuſtrate this by the helpe of the former
compariſon begun; If as <hi>Abels</hi> blood cries, ſo
alſo it proves that <hi>Abels</hi> ſoul lives to cry; that both
his cauſe cries and himſelfe lives to follow it: So
that the cry of <hi>Abels</hi> blood is ſeconded with the
cry of <hi>Abels</hi> ſoule that lives, how doubly forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
muſt this needs be? And thus indeede you
have it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 9. where it is ſaid that [<hi>the ſoules]
of them which were ſlain for the teſtimony which they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:155276:99"/>
held, [cryed] with a loud voyce, ſaying, How long, O
Lord, holy and true, doſt thou not avenge our blood?</hi>
Yea, ſee that not onely their bloud cryes, but
their ſoules live, and live to cry. And it is not
ſpoken Metaphorically of their ſoules, but what
is truly done by them now in Heaven, it being
mentioned to ſhew how and by what God was
moved to bring vengeance on the Heatheniſh
Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> that had ſhed their blood. Now
not only Chriſts <hi>ſoule</hi> (as theirs) lives to cry, but
his whole perſon; for he is <hi>riſen againe,</hi> and lives
to intercede for ever. In the <hi>Revel. 1. ver.</hi> 18.
Chriſt appearing to <hi>Iohn,</hi> when he would ſpeake
but one ſpeech that ſhould move all in him,
he ſayes but this, <hi>I am he that liveth, and was
dead,</hi> and dyed for thee. And whoſe heart doth it
not move, to reade it with faith? and doth it
not move his Father (think you) who was the
chiefe cauſe and motioner of his death) to think,
<hi>My Sonne</hi> that was dead, and dyed at my requeſt
for ſinners, is now alive again, and liveth to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede,
and liveth to <hi>ſee the travaile of his ſoule</hi>
fulfilled and ſatisfied? God pronounceth this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it in that 53. of <hi>Eſay, ver. 10. By his knowledge</hi>
(or faith in him) <hi>ſhall he juſtify many;</hi> even as many
as he dyed for. <hi>Who then ſhall condemne? Chriſt
that was dead is alive, and liveth to intercede.</hi>

is taken from this, that God hath put all power
into his hand, to doe what ever hee will, hath
made him his King to doe what pleaſeth him
either in Heaven, Earth, or Hell; yea to doe
all that God himſelfe ever meanes to doe, or
all that God deſires to doe: And certainly if his
Father hath beene ſo gracious to him as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
ſo high and abſolute a ſoveraignty on him,
as to accompliſh and effect what ever he meanes
to do, ſurely his purpoſe was never to deny Chriſt
any requeſt, that he ſhould after this make: he
would never have advanced the Humane nature
to that abſoluteneſſe elſe. Thoſe two great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
made great grants and largeſſes, the one to
<hi>Eſther,</hi> the other to <hi>Herodias</hi> daughter; but yet they
were limited only to the halfe of their Kingdoms:
ſo <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. and <hi>Eſt.</hi> 5. 6. and the royall power in
their Kingdomes, they meant ſtill to retain and
reſerve wholly to themſelves: But God having
placed Chriſt on his Throne, bids him ask even
to the whole of his Kingdome, for God hath
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:155276:100"/>
made him a King, ſitting on his Throne with
him, not to ſhare halves, but to have all power
in heaven and earth; <hi>He hath committed all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

ever he will; and ſo farre as the Kingdome of
God goes, or is extended, he may doe any thing.
So <hi>Iohn 5. 21. As the Father raiſeth up the dead,
ſo the Sonne quickneth whom he will; for as the Father
hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he given to the Sonne
to have life in himſelfe, ver.</hi> 26. and hath in like
manner <hi>given authority to execute judgement alſo,</hi>
as the <hi>Sonne of man,</hi> (namely, of himſelfe) <hi>ver.</hi> 27.

what ever he would have done, and it is ſtraight
done; if he ſhall ask and entreat, what will not
be done? As a King who ſues for Peace, backt
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:155276:101"/>
with a potent Army which is able to win what
he entreats for, muſt needs treat more effectually:
So doth Chriſt ſue for every thing, with power
to effect it. Remember that he is ſaid here in
the Text, firſt to be at Gods right hand, and then
to intercede. He treats the ſalvation of ſinners,
as a mighty Prince treats the giving up ſome
Towne to him, which lyes ſeated under a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of his, which commands that Towne: hee
ſtands treating with the Governour, having his
Ordnance ready for the battery, and to bring
all into ſubjection,<note place="margin">That this is a conſideration upon which God denyes him nothing.</note> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. And this is a
conſideration that God himſelfe took, in that
2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> when he made him that promiſe, (<hi>Ask &amp;
I will give thee</hi>) why he made ſo large a grant:
He had ſaid before, <hi>ver. 6. I have ſet my King
upon my holy hill of Sion,</hi> (which made him (one
would think) paſt asking) and above the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an Interceſſour. Now God ſayes of him,
He is <hi>My King,</hi> not in reſpect of his commanding
God, (that were blaſphemie to think) but it is
ſpoken in reſpect of commanding all below him.
God having ſet him in his Throne, to doe as
much as he himſelfe would (or meanes) to have
done, ſayes, He is my King to rule all, not ſo
much under me, as for me, and in my ſtead; yet
abſolutely, and in himſelfe, <hi>The Father judgeth
no man.</hi> Now when the Father had firſt made
and conſtituted him thus great a King, then he
bids him Ask, to whom he had firſt given this
abſolute power to command. We may (without
blaſphemy) ſay of this God-man, that God hath
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:155276:101"/>
(not onely not the heart, as being his Father,
but) not the power to croſſe any thing he doth.
Thus faſt hath he God unto him. Onely he (who
in reſpect of this his power is to be honoured as
the Father, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 23. yet) to honour his
Father, who gave this power originally to him
as Mediatour; He is to ask for that which of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
he yet can doe. And therefore (ſayes God)
though thou art a King, (ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 6.) and all my
Kingdome, even <hi>the utmoſt ends of the earth</hi> are
<hi>thine inheritance</hi> by a naturall right, now that
thou art my Sonne, (as <hi>verſe</hi> 8.) yet becauſe
thou art <hi>My King,</hi> of my appointing, and <hi>I have
ſet thee</hi> on the Throne, (as the word is, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.)
and (<hi>Thou art my Son, and I have begotten thee</hi>) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
acknowledge my grant in all, <hi>Ask of me, and
I will give thee the utmoſt ends of the earth for thy
inheritance:</hi> I cannot deny thee, but I would have
thee aske; And therefore Chriſt asks. Yet ſtill
withall remember, that he asks, who can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the thing to be done: and yet, as he muſt
ask ere the thing be done; ſo if he aske, it muſt
needs be granted. Theſe are the termes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
this Father and this Sonne; who (in a
word) had not beene ſo great a Father, if he had
not had a Sonne thus great, that himſelfe could
not deny what this Sonne would have done: it is
for his owne honour, to have ſuch a Sonne: So
<hi>Iohn 5. 23. That they might honour the Sonne, as
they honour the Father,</hi> therefore <hi>All judgement is
committed to him.</hi> Now then, if he who hath ſo
much power, will joyne the force of entreaty
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:155276:102"/>
with a Father that ſo loves him; if he who is
<hi>The Word of his Father,</hi> that commands, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,
and upholds all, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. [<hi>He ſpake,
and it was done</hi>] if he will become a Word to
his Father, and ſpeak a word for us, and aske
all that he means to doe; how forcible will ſuch
words be?</p>
                     <p>Therefore obſerve Chriſts manner of praying,<note place="margin">How forcible Chriſts prayers and interceſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt needs be, by an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the prevalencie of ours.</note>
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. (which Prayer is a plat-form of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
in Heaven) <hi>ver.</hi> 24. [<hi>Father I will] that they
whom thou haſt given mee, be where I am.</hi> He prays
like a King, who is in joint commiſſion with God.
If God puts that honour upon our Prayers, that
we are ſaid <hi>to have power with God,</hi> as <hi>Iacob, Hoſ.</hi> 12.
3. that if God be never ſo angry, yet by <hi>taking
hold of his ſtrength,</hi> wee hold <hi>his hands,</hi> as <hi>Eſay</hi>
27. 5. that God cries out to <hi>Moſes,</hi> like a man
whoſe hands are held, <hi>Let me alone, Exod.</hi> 32.
10. yea that he accounts it as a <hi>command</hi> and a
<hi>Mandamus,</hi> ſo he ſtyles it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. 11. [<hi>Command
ye mee</hi>] ſo unable is he to go againſt it. Then how
much more doth Jeſus Chriſts Interceſſion bind
Gods hands, and command all in heaven and
earth? Therefore <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. you have Chriſt, <hi>the
Angel of the Covenant,</hi> brought in interceding
with the Father for his Church, and he ſpeakes
abruptly as one full of complaints, and in an
expoſtulating way, [<hi>O Lord of Hoſts, how long, wilt
thou not be mercifull to Hieruſalem and the Cities of
Iudah?</hi>] and <hi>ver. 13. Zachary</hi> ſaith that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that the <hi>Lord anſwered the Angel with
good woords and comfortable.</hi> God was fain to give
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:155276:102"/>
him good words (as we uſe to ſay) that is, words
that might pacifie him as words of comfort to
us, ſo good words in reſpect to the Angels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.
And you may obſerve, how in the anſwer
God returns upon it, (which he bade <hi>Zachary</hi>
write) God excuſeth it (as it were) to Chriſt,
that his Church had beene ſo long and ſo hardly
dealt withall; as if beyond his intention, he layes
the fault on the inſtruments, <hi>I was but a little
diſpleaſed, but they helpt forward the affliction; ver.</hi>
15. This is ſpoken and carried after the manner
of men, to ſhew how tender God is of diſpleaſing
Chriſt our Interceſſor: that when Chriſt hath (as
it were) beene a long while ſilent, and let God
alone, and his people have beene ill dealt withall;
he on the ſuddain in the end intercedes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of it, and it is not only inſtantly redreſſed,
but excuſed for times paſt, with <hi>good words, and
comfortable words.</hi> Chriſts Father will not diſpleaſe
him, nor go againſt him in any thing.</p>
                     <p>Now that you may ſee a reaſon of this,<note place="margin">A farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</note> and
have all cavils and exceptions taken away, that
may ariſe againſt this; and how that there is an
impoſſibility that it ſhould be otherwiſe: know,
that this Father and this Sonne, though two
Perſons, have yet but one will betweene
them, and but one power betweene them,
(though the Sonne <hi>ad extra</hi> outwardly executes
all) <hi>Iohn 10. 30. My Father and I are one;</hi> that is,
have but one and the ſame power to ſave you,
and one minde and will: So alſo, <hi>Iohn 5. 19. the
Sonne can doe nothing of himſelfe, but what he ſees
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:155276:103"/>
the Father doe, and what ever he doth, the ſame the
Father doth alſo:</hi> they conſpire in one, have one
power, one will: and then it is no matter though
God commit all power to the Sonne, and that
the Sonne though he hath all power, muſt ask
all of the Father, for to be ſure what ever
he asks, the Father hath not power to deny; for
they have but one will and power. They are one;
ſo as if God deny him, hee muſt deny himſelfe,
which the Apoſtle tels us he cannot doe, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
13. And ſo in the ſame ſenſe that God is ſaid
<hi>not to have power to deny himſelfe;</hi> in the ſame ſenſe
it may be ſaid, he hath not power to deny Chriſt
what he asks. Therefore God might well make
him an abſolute King, and betruſt him with
all power; and Chriſt might well oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
notwithſtanding this power, to ask all that
he meanes to doe; for they have but one will
and one power, ſo as our ſalvation is made ſure
by this on all hands. [<hi>I come not to doe my will,
but the will of him who ſent me; and his will is,
that I ſhall loſe none of all thoſe whom he hath given
mee,] Iohn</hi> 6. 38, 39. And therefore <hi>who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne?
It is Chriſt that intercedes.</hi> As <hi>who ſhall
reſiſt Gods will?</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) ſo who
ſhall reſiſt or gain-ſay Chriſts Interceſſion? God
himſelfe cannot, no more then he can gain-ſay,
or deny himſelfe.</p>

as elſewhere, but [<hi>With the Father.</hi>] And
that his words might afford the more full matter
of confidence, and be the more comprehenſive,

God limitedly, as confined to his Fatherhood, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unto Chriſt onely, or us alone: He ſayes
not onely [<hi>An Advocate with his Father,</hi>] though
that would have given much aſſurance, or [<hi>With

us of the prevailing efficacie of Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,
<note place="margin">In that he is both the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt,</hi> and alſo <hi>our Father.</hi>
                        </note> from both. You have both theſe
elſewhere more diſtinctly, and on purpoſe, and
<hi>together</hi> mentioned, <hi>Iohn 20. 17. I goe to my Father,
and your Father,</hi> ſayes Chriſt there: And it was
ſpoken after that all his Diſciples had before
forſaken him, and <hi>Peter</hi> denyed him; when <hi>Chriſt</hi>
himſelfe would ſend them the greateſt cordiall
that his heart could utter, and wrap up the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
ſublimation of comforts in one pill; What
was it? Go tell them, (ſayes he) not ſo much that
I have ſatisfyed for ſinne, overcome death, or
am riſen, but that I <hi>Aſcend:</hi> For in that which
Chriſt doth for us being aſcended, lyes the
height, the top of our comfort. And whereas
he might have ſaid, (and it had been matter of
unſpeakable comfort) I aſcend to heaven, and
ſo where I am, you ſhall be alſo; yet he chooſeth
rather to ſay, [<hi>I aſcend to the Father,</hi>] for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:155276:106"/>
contained the foundation, ſpring, and cauſe
of their comfort; even that relation of Gods,
[his Fatherhood] with which Chriſt was to deal
after his aſcending, for them. And becauſe
when before his death he had ſpoken of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Father, their hearts had been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 28. they thinking it was for his
owne preferment onely, (as Chriſts ſpeech there
implyes they did) therefore he here diſtinctly
addes, <hi>I aſcend to my Father and your Father, to my
God and your God.</hi> He had in effect ſpoken as much
before, in the words fore-going, <hi>Goe tell my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
but that was onely <hi>implicitely;</hi> therefore
more plainly and <hi>explicitely</hi> he ſayes it, for their
further comfort, [<hi>I goe to my Father, and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>]
And conſider, that Chriſt being now new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
riſen, and having as yet not ſeen his Diſciples,
and being now to ſend a meſſage, his firſt meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
a Goſpel of good tidings to them, (and that
in a briefe ſentence) by a woman; he chooſeth
out this as the firſt word to be ſpoken from him
now, when he was come out of the other world,
at their firſt heare-ſay of his return, he utters
forth at once, the bottome, the depth of all
comfort, the ſumme of all joy; then which the
Goſpel knows no greater, nor can go higher: So
as if Chriſt ſhould intend now at this day to ſend
good news from Heaven to any of you, it would
be but this, I am here an Advocate, interceding
with my Father, and thy Father. All is ſpoken
in that. Even [<hi>He</hi>] could not ſpeake more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
who is the God of comfort. Now therefore
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:155276:107"/>
let us apart conſider theſe two relations, which
afford each of them their proper comfort and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance;
both that Chriſt is aſcended, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
with <hi>his</hi> own <hi>Father;</hi> and alſo with <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
and therefore how prevailing muſt this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
be?</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. That Chriſt intercedes with <hi>his Father.</hi>
                        </note> Chriſt intercedes with his Father, who
neither will nor can deny him any thing. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
this, you have a double Teſtimony, and of
two of the greateſt witneſſes in Heaven: both a
Teſtimony of <hi>Chriſts</hi> owne, whilſt he was on
Earth; and Gods own word alſo declared, ſince
Chriſt came to Heaven. The 1. in the 11. of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
whilſt Chriſt was here on earth, and had not as
then fully performed that great ſervice which
he was to finiſh; which ſince he having done, it
muſt needs ingratiate him the more vvith God
his Father. When <hi>Lazarus</hi> was now foure dayes
dead, <hi>Martha,</hi> to move Chriſt to pittie her, firſt
tels him, that if he had been there before her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dyed, that then he had not dyed: and then
(as having ſpoke too little) ſhee adds, yea thou
canſt (if thou pleaſeſt) remedie it yet. <hi>But I know</hi>
(ſayes ſhe, <hi>ver.</hi> 22.) <hi>that even now</hi> (though he be
ſo long dead) <hi>what ever thou wilt ask of God, God
will give it thee.</hi> Here was her confidence in Chriſts
Interceſſion, though this were a greater worke
then ever yet CHRIST had done any. And
Chriſt ſeeing her faith in this, he confirmes her
ſpeech when he came to raiſe him, and takes a
ſolemn occaſion to declare, that God had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
denyed him any requeſt that he had ever
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:155276:107"/>
put up to him, firſt thanking God particularly
that he had heard him in this, <hi>ver. 41. Father, I
thank thee, that thou haſt heard me:</hi> He had (it ſeems)
prayed for the thing at her entreaty; and now,
before the thing was done, he (being aſſured his
prayer was heard) gives thanks; ſo confident
was he of his being heard. And then ſecondly,
ſhews upon what this his confidence at this time
was grounded, his conſtant experience that God
had never denyed him any requeſt; for it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>ver. 42. And I know that thou heareſt me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,</hi>
(and therefore was ſo bold, as to expreſſe
my confidence in this, before the thing was done)
<hi>but becauſe of them who ſtood by, I ſaid it.</hi> As if hee
had ſaid, Though I gave this publique thanks for
being heard onely in this one miracle, and at no
time the like ſo publiquely; yet this is no new
thing, but thus it hath been alwayes hitherto,
in all the miracles I have wrought, and requeſts
I have put up, which made me ſo to give thanks
before-hand: and this is not the firſt time that
God hath heard me thus; which I ſpeak, that
they might beleeve. Thus he was never denyed
on earth, from the firſt to the laſt. For this
was one of his greateſt miracles, and reſerved
unto the laſt, even a few dayes before his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying.</p>
                     <p>And now he hath performed the ſervice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
him, and is come to heaven, let us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
heare God himſelfe ſpeake, what hee
meanes to doe for him. You heard before, when
he came firſt to heaven, what God ſaid to him,

and how he welcommed him with a [<hi>Sit thou at
my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy foot-ſtool:</hi>]
And before Chriſt opened his mouth to ſpeak a
word, by way of any requeſt to God, (which
was the office that he was now to execute) God
himſelfe prevented him, and added, [<hi>Thou art
my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee: Ask of me,
and I will give thee, Pſal. 2. ver.</hi> 8.] He ſpeaks it at
Chriſts firſt comming up to heaven, when he
had <hi>his King on his holy hill,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Chriſt was
new glorifyed, which was as a new begetting to
him, <hi>To day have I begotten thee:</hi> And this is, as
if he had ſaid, I know you will ask me now for
all that you have dyed for; and this I promiſe
you before-hand, before you ſpeak a word, or
make any requeſt unto me, you ſhall ask nothing
but it ſhall be granted; and this I ſpeak once for
all, as a boone and a grace granted you upon
your birth-day, as the ſolemneſt celebration of
it, (for ſuch was his Reſurrection, and Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and ſitting at Gods right hand) <hi>This day
have I begotten thee; Ask of mee and I will give
thee.</hi> So full of joy was his Fathers heart, that
he had his Sonne in Heaven with him, whom he
had begotten from everlaſting, and ordained
<hi>to this glory,</hi> who was lately dead, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
loſt, and therefore now (as it were) new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.
Gods heart was ſo full, that he could not
hold from expreſſing it in the largeſt favours and
grants. And whereas Kings upon their own
birth-dayes, uſe to grant ſuch favours to their
favourites: So <hi>Herod</hi> on his birth-day to the

Daughter of <hi>Herodias,</hi> promiſed with an oath
to give her whatſoever ſhe would ask, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 7.
God himſelfe having no birth-day, nor being
of himſelfe capable of it, yet having a Sonne
who had, he honours him with that grace upon
that day; and if <hi>Q. Eſther</hi> (a Subject, yea, a
ſlave in her originall condition) was ſo prevalent
for the <hi>Iews</hi> her People and Nation, when their
caſe was deſperate, and when there was an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable

                     <head type="sub">The potencie of Chriſts Interceſsion, demonſtrated, in
that he intercedes with God, who is Our Father.
How Gods heart is as much inclined to heare Chriſt
for us, as Chriſts is to intercede.</head>
                     <p>SEcondly, Chriſt is an Advocate for us with
<hi>Our Father:</hi> You may perhaps think there is
little in that; but Chriſt puts much upon it: yea
ſo much, as if that God would however grant
all that Chriſt himſelfe means to ask, whether
Chriſt asked it or no. This you have expreſly
in <hi>Iohn 16. 26, 27. At that day</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>you
ſhall ask in my name, and I ſay not to you, that I will
pray the Father for you; for the Father himſelfe loveth
you.</hi> To open this place, where he ſayes [<hi>at that
day;</hi>] The day he meanes through this whole
Chapter, is that time vvhen the holy Ghoſt
ſhould be ſhed upon them: for throughout his
diſcourſe, he ſtil ſpeaks of the fruits of his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and of giving the Comforter, vvhich vvas
done upon his aſcending, and vvas the firſt fruits
of his prieſtly office in Heaven. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, <hi>Act. 2. 33. He being</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the right hand of God, and having received</hi>
(namely by asking, <hi>Ask and I will give thee) of the
Father the promiſe of the holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed
forth this, which you now ſee and heare.</hi> Now of that
time, vvhen he ſhall be in Heaven, he ſayes, <hi>I
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:155276:110"/>
ſay not that I will pray for you:</hi> vvhich is not meant,
that Chriſt prays not for us in heaven, but rather
thoſe very vvords are the higheſt intimation,
that he vvould and doth pray for us, that can be.
When men vvould moſt ſtrongly intimate their
purpoſe of a kindneſſe they mean to doe for one,
they uſe to ſay, I doe not ſay that I love you, or
that I will doe this or that for you; which is as
much as to ſay, I will ſurely doe it, and doe it to
purpoſe. But Chriſts ſcope here is, as in the
higheſt manner to promiſe them that he would
pray for them; ſo withall, further to tell them
for their more abundant aſſurance and ſecurity,
that beſides their having the benefit of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<hi>God</hi> himſelfe <hi>ſo loves them</hi> of himſelfe, that
indeed that alone were enough to obtaine any
thing at his hands, which they ſhall but ask in
his name; ſo as he needs not pray for them, and
yet he will too. But now in this caſe, if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
pray for them, and they themſelves in his
name, and both unto a Father, who of himſelfe
loveth them, and who hath purpoſed to grant
all, before either he, or they ſhould ask; vvhat
hope muſt there needs be then of a good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe?
this is both the meaning of this place,
and a great truth to be conſidered on by us, to
the purpoſe in hand: That it is the meaning of
the place, the manner of Chriſts ſpeech implies,
[<hi>I ſay not that I will pray the Father for you, for the
Father himſelfe loveth you.</hi>] It is ſuch a ſpeech as
Chriſt uſed upon a cleane contrary occaſion,
<hi>Iohn 5. 45. Doe not thinke</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:155276:111"/>
you to the Father, there is one who accuſeth you, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> He there threatens the obſtinate
and accurſed <hi>Phariſees</hi> with condemnation: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſtand thinking that it is I (ſayes he) who am
your onely enemie and accuſer, that will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
your condemnation, and ſo proſecute the
matter againſt you meerely for my own intereſt;
no, I ſhall not neede to doe it: though I ſhould
not accuſe you, <hi>your owne Moſes in whom you
truſt,</hi> he is enough to condemne you, he will
doe your errand ſufficiently, you would be ſure
to be damned by his words and ſayings; I ſhall
not neede to trouble my ſelfe to come in and
enter my action againſt you too, <hi>Moſes</hi> and his
Law would follow the ſuit, and be enough to
condemne you to Hel. So as this Speech doth not
implie that Chriſt will not at all accuſe them;
no, he meanes to bring in his action againſt them
too: for he after ſayes, <hi>If he had not ſpoke to them,
they had had no ſinne,</hi> and therefore he meant
to bring the greateſt accuſation of all. Now in an
oppoſite (though parallel) ſpeech here, to comfort
his Diſciples, he ſayes [I ſay not that I will pray
for you] that God may ſave you, I who your
ſelves ſhall ſee will dye for you, I ſay not that I
will pray for you, not I. But though I ſpeake this
to inſinuate in the higheſt manner, that I will;
(for if I ſpend my blood for you, will I not ſpend
my breath for you?) yet the truth is, that the caſe
ſo ſtands, that but for Gods own ordination, I
ſhould not neede to doe it, <hi>for the Father himſelfe
loves you:</hi> (that is) the Father of his own motion,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:155276:111"/>
and proper good will taken up of himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, and not wrought in him by me, doth
love you, and beares ſo much love to you, as he
can deny you nothing, for he is <hi>your Father</hi> as well
as mine. How much more then ſhall you be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
when I ſhall ſtrike in too, and uſe all my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in him for you? Chriſt on purpoſe uſeth
this ſpeech, ſo to daſh out of their hearts that
conceit, which harboureth in many of ours, who
look upon God in the matter of Salvation, as one
who is hardly entreated to come off, to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and with whom Chriſt (through the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe
of his heart) hath ſo much adoe; and
we are apt to think that when he doth come off
to pardon, he doth it only &amp; meerly at Chriſts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty,
and for his ſake, having otherwiſe no innate
motion in himſelfe ſufficient to encline his heart
to it; but that it is in this tranſaction by Chriſt
with him, as a Favourite procures a Pardon for a
Traitor, whoſe perſon the King cares not for; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at his Favourites ſuit and requeſt he grants it,
which elſe he would never have done. You are
deceived, ſayes Chriſt, it is otherwiſe: my Fathers
heart is as much towards you, and for your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as mine is: Himſelfe of himſelfe loveth
you. And the truth is, that God took up as vaſt a
love unto us of himſelfe at firſt, as ever he hath
borne us ſince: and all that Chriſt doth for us, is
but the expreſſion of that love which was taken
up originally in Gods owne heart. Thus we find,
that out of that love he gave Chriſt for us: So
<hi>Iohn 3. 16. God ſo loved the world</hi> (of elect) <hi>that he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:155276:112"/>
gave his onely begotten Sonne to dye, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, Chriſts
death was but a meanes <hi>to commend</hi> or ſet forth
<hi>that love</hi> of his unto us: So <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. it was God
alſo that did himſelfe give the perſons unto
Chriſt, and under-hand ſet him on work to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
for them: <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the
World to himſelfe:</hi> He onely uſed Chriſt as his
inſtrument to bring it honourably about. <hi>All the
Bleſsings</hi> he means to give us, he firſt purpoſed and
intended in himſelfe: (ſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 5, 9, 11.
compared) <hi>out of the good pleaſure of his will,</hi> yet
[<hi>in Chriſt</hi>] as it is added there, as the means
through which hee would convey them: yea
Chriſt adds not one drop of love to Gods heart;
onely he draws it out, he brocheth it, and makes
it flow forth, whoſe current had otherwiſe
beene ſtopt. The truth is, that God ſuborned
Chriſt to beg them on our behalf for an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
way of carrying it, and to make us prize this
favour of it the more; but ſo, as his heart is as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to give all to us, as Chriſts is to ask, and this out
of his pure love to us.</p>
                     <p>The Interceſſion therefore of Chriſt muſt
needs ſpeed, when Gods heart is thus of it ſelfe
prepared to us. In <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 10. it is ſaid, <hi>The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand:</hi> If our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
be in Chriſts hand, it is in a good hand;
but if it be the pleaſure of the Lord too, it muſt
needs proſper. And it is ſaid of our hearts and
prayers, that <hi>He prepareth the heart, and heareth
the prayer;</hi> much more therefore when his owne
heart is prepared to grant the ſuit, will he eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:155276:112"/>
heare it. When one hath a mind to doe a
thing, then the leaſt hint procures it of him: So
a father having a mind to ſpare his child, he will
take any excuſe, any ones mediation, even of a
ſervant, a ſtranger, or an enemie, rather then of
none. Now when Chriſt ſhall ſpeak for us, and
ſpeak Gods owne heart, how prevalent muſt
thoſe words needs be? <hi>Davids</hi> ſoule <hi>longing to goe
forth unto Abſalom,</hi> (2 <hi>Sam. 13. ult.</hi>) whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
(for the honour of a Father, and a
Kings State-policie, and to ſatisfie the world) he
had baniſht the Court for his Treaſon; when <hi>Ioab</hi>
perceived it, that <hi>the Kings heart was towards Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,
(Chap.</hi> 14. 1.) and that the King onely needed
one to ſpeake a good word for him, he ſubornes
a woman, a ſtranger (no matter whom, for it
had beene all one for ſpeeding) with a made
tale to come to the King; and you know how
eaſily it tooke and prevailed with him, and how
glad the Kings heart was of that occaſion: even
ſo acceptable it was to him, that <hi>Ioab</hi> could not
have done him a greater kindneſſe; and that
<hi>Ioab</hi> knew well enough. Thus it is with Gods
heart towards us, Chriſt aſſures us of it, and
you may believe him in this caſe, for Chriſt
might have tooke all the Honour to himſelfe,
and made us beholding to himſelfe alone for all
Gods kindnes to us; but he deales plainly, and
tels us that his Father is as ready as himſelfe;
and this for his Fathers honour and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
And therefore it is that, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. in that this
prayer ſo operated on this diſcourſe, he pleads our
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:155276:113"/>
election, <hi>Iohn 17. 6. Thine they were, and thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
them me;</hi> Thou commendedſt them unto me,
and badeſt me pray for them, and I doe but
commend the ſame to thee again. In the High-prieſts
breaſt-plate when he went into the Holy
of Holies, were ſet twelve ſtones, on which
were written the names of the twelve Tribes:
the myſterie of which is this, Chriſt beares us and
our names in his Heart, when he goes to God:
and moreover, we are Gods jewels, precious in
his own account and choiſe. So God calls them
<hi>Mal. 3. 17. Made precious to him out of his love.</hi> So
<hi>Iſai.</hi> 43. 4. So that God loves us as jewels cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
by him, but much more when he beholds us
ſet and preſented unto him in the breaſt-plate of
Chriſts heart and prayer.</p>
                     <p>To conclude therefore, we have now made
both ends of this Text to meet, Gods love, and
Chriſts interceſſion. The Apoſtle began with
that, <hi>Who ſhall accuſe? it is God that juſtifies,</hi> and
he being for us, <hi>who can be againſt us?</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
himſelf loves <hi>us</hi> as he is <hi>our</hi> Father: And then
he ends with this, <hi>Chriſt intercedes,</hi> namely, with
our Father and his Father, <hi>Who then ſhall condemn?</hi>
Who, or what can poſſibly condemne, all theſe
things being for us, the leaſt of which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
enough to ſave us?</p>
                     <p>Let us now looke round about, and take a full
view and proſpect at once, of all thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
that Chriſt hath done and doth for us, and
their ſeverall and joynt <hi>influence</hi> which they have
into our ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:155276:113"/>
1. In that Chriſt <hi>dyed,</hi> it aſſures us of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>price</hi> payed for, and a <hi>right</hi> to eternall life
thereby acquired.</p>
                     <p>2. In that he <hi>roſe again</hi> as a common perſon,
this aſſures us yet further, that there is a formall,
<hi>legall,</hi> and irrevocable <hi>act</hi> of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> of us paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and enrolled in that Court of Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Chriſt and God: and that in his being
then juſtifyed, we were alſo juſtified him, ſo
that thereby our juſtification is made paſt re-cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                     <p>3 Chriſts <hi>Aſcenſion into Heaven,</hi> is a further act
of his taking <hi>poſſeſsion</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> for us, he then
formally entring upon that our right in our ſtead;
and ſo is a further confirmation of our ſalvation
to us. But ſtill we in our owne perſons are not
yet ſaved, this being but done to us as we are
repreſentatively in Chriſt as our Head.</p>
                     <p>4. Therefore he <hi>ſits at Gods right hand,</hi> vvhich
imports his being armed and inveſted with <hi>all
power in Heaven and Earth to give</hi> and apply <hi>eternall
life</hi> to us.</p>
                     <p>5. And laſt of all there remaines <hi>Interceſsion</hi>
to <hi>finiſh</hi> and <hi>compleat</hi> our ſalvation; to <hi>doe</hi> the
thing, even to <hi>ſave</hi> us. And as Chriſts <hi>death</hi> &amp; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſurrection</hi>
were to procure our <hi>Iuſtification:</hi> ſo
<hi>his ſitting at Gods right hand</hi> and <hi>Interceſsion</hi> are
to procure <hi>ſalvation;</hi> and by faith we may ſee it
done, and behold our ſoules not onely ſitting in
heaven, as in Chriſt a common perſon ſitting
there in our right; as an evidence that we ſhall
come thither: but alſo through Chriſts <hi>Interceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                        <pb n="194" facs="tcp:155276:114"/>
begun vve may ſee our ſelves actually poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

that are believers by faith poſſeſſed of it, and
ſolacing your ſoules in it, and doe you feare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation

words (as any in the booke of God) doe hold
forth, which the Apoſtle hath uttered concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Chriſts Interceſſion (the Point in hand;)
[<hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave to the utmoſt, thoſe that

as a ſufficient Abundary of <hi>Conſolation</hi> unto

to all miſgivings and diſcouragements what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                     <p>1. A Definition of Faith; and ſuch, as will
ſuit the weakeſt Beleever. <hi>It is a comming unto
God by Chriſt for Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. It is [<hi>a comming</hi>] to be ſaved. Let not the
want of <hi>Aſſurance</hi> that God will ſave thee, or that
Chriſt is thine, diſcourage thee, if thou haſt but
a heart to <hi>Come</hi> to God by Chriſt to be ſaved,
though thou knoweſt not whether he will yet
ſave thee, or no. Remember that the Beleevers
of the New Teſtament are here deſcribed to be
[<hi>commers</hi>] to God by Chriſt; Such as <hi>goe out</hi> of
themſelves, and reſt in nothing in themſelves, do
<hi>come</hi> unto God through Chriſt for Salvation,
though with trembling.</p>
                     <p>2. It is a Comming [<hi>unto God.</hi>] For he is the
ultimate object of our Faith, and the perſon with
whom we have to do in believing, &amp; from whom
we are to receive Salvation, if ever we obtaine it.</p>
                     <p>3. It is a Comming unto God [<hi>by Chriſt:</hi>]
which Phraſe is uſed in this Epiſtle in an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the worſhipers of the Old Teſtament; who
when they had ſinned, were directed to go to
God by <hi>a Prieſt,</hi> who with a Sacrifice made an
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:155276:115"/>
Atonement for them. Now Chriſt is the great
and true High-Prieſt, <hi>by whom we have acceſſe to the
Father; 2. Epheſ.</hi> 18. The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by the hand.</hi> Doeſt thou not know how to
appeare before God or to come to him? come
firſt to Chriſt, and he will take thee by the hand,
and go along with thee, and leade thee to His
Father.</p>
                     <p>4. It is a comming unto God by Chriſt [<hi>for
Salvation.</hi>] Many a poore ſoule is apt to thinke
that in comming to God by Faith it muſt not
aime at it ſelfe, or its own Salvation: yes, it may,
for that is here made the errand or buſineſſe
which faith hath with God in comming to him;
or which it comes for, and this is ſecretly couched
in theſe words: for the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the
very aime of the heart in comming, he therefore
on purpoſe mentions Chriſts ability to <hi>ſave;</hi>
[He is able <hi>to ſave.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Here are many encouragements to
ſuch a <hi>Faith</hi> as is not yet grown up unto aſſurance
of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>1. Here is the moſt ſuitable object propounded
unto it, namely, <hi>Chriſt as Interceding;</hi> which work
of Interceſſion becauſe it remains for Chriſt as <hi>yet
to doe</hi> for a ſoule that is to be ſaved, and which
he is every day <hi>a doing</hi> for us; therefore it is more
peculiarly fitted unto a <hi>Recumbents Faith.</hi> For
when ſuch a ſoule comes and <hi>caſts it ſelfe</hi> upon
<hi>Chriſt, That</hi> thing in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which muſt needs moſt
ſuit that kind of Act, is that which is <hi>yet to be done</hi>
by Chriſt for that ſoule. Now for that ſoule to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:155276:115"/>
                        <hi>come</hi> to Chriſt to die for it, and offer up himſelfe
a Sacrifice, (as Sinners did uſe to come to the
High-Prieſt to ſacrifice for them) this were
bootleſſe, for (as it is <hi>ver.</hi> 27.) he hath at <hi>once done
that</hi> already. And as for <hi>what is</hi> already <hi>paſt</hi> and
<hi>done,</hi> ſuch a beleevers faith is oftentimes exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
puzled, what manner of act to put forth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Chriſt about it: as (for example) when it is
about to come unto God, &amp; it heares of an <hi>Election</hi>
of ſome unto ſalvation from all eternity made by
him; becauſe this is an act already paſt by God,
the ſoule knows it to be in vain to caſt it ſelfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God for Election, or to come unto him to elect
&amp; chooſe it ſelfe. And ſo in like manner, when the
ſoule lookes upon <hi>Chriſts Death;</hi> becauſe it is
done and paſt, it knowes not how to take it in
in beleeving, when it wanteth aſſurance that
Chriſt dyed for it, (though it ſhould come to
Chriſt to bee ſaved by vertue of his <hi>death.</hi>) But
there is this one worke that remaines ſtill to be
done by him for us, and which he is daily a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and that is, <hi>Interceding,</hi> for <hi>he lives ever to
Intercede,</hi> or to <hi>pray</hi> for us in the ſtrength and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of that his Sacrifice once offered up. This
therefore is more directly &amp; peculiarly fitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Recumbency,</hi> or, of <hi>Comming unto Chriſt:</hi>
the proper act of ſuch a Faith (as it is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
from <hi>Faith of Aſſurance</hi>) being <hi>a caſting ones
ſelfe upon Chriſt for ſome thing it would have done or
wrought for one.</hi> Hence Interceſſion becomes a
fit object for the aime and errand of ſuch a Faith,
in this its comming to Chriſt, as alſo [<hi>to be ſaved</hi>]
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:155276:116"/>
is, it being a thing yet to bee wrought and
accompliſht for me by Chriſt, is therefore a fit
marke for ſuch a Faith to levell at in its comming
to Chriſt. Thoſe Acts of God and Chriſt which
are paſt, <hi>Faith of Aſſurance</hi> doth more eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with: ſuch a Faith takes in with comfort that
Chriſt hath <hi>dyed</hi> for me, and <hi>riſen</hi> again, and
doth now <hi>Intercede</hi> for me, and ſo I ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be ſaved: but ſo cannot this weake faith
doe. Come thou therefore unto Chriſt, as to
ſave thee through his Death paſt, and by the
merit of it, ſo for the preſent, and for the time
to come, to take thy Cauſe in hand, and to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede</hi>
for thee: it is a great reliefe unto ſuch a
Faith (as cannot put forth Acts of Aſſurance,
that what hath beene done by Chriſt hath been
done for it) that God hath left Chriſt this work
yet to doe for us. So as the Interceſſion of Chriſt
may afford matter to ſuch a Faith to throw it
ſelfe upon Chriſt, to performe it for us, and it
may ſet him aworke to doe it.</p>
                     <p>2. Now if ſuch a ſoule aske, But will Chriſt
upon my comming to him for ſalvation, be ſet
avvork to intercede for mee, and undertake my
cauſe?</p>
                     <p>I anſvver it out of thoſe vvords, [<hi>He lives to
intercede for them who come to God by him.</hi>] He lives
on purpoſe to performe this vvork; it is the end
of his living, the buſineſſe of his life. And as he
received a commandment to dye, and it was the
end of his life on earth; ſo he hath received a
command to intercede, and to be a common
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:155276:116"/>
High-Prieſt for all that come to God by him.
God hath appointed him to this work by an oath,
<hi>He ſware, and would not repent, Thou ſhalt be a Prieſt
for ever, after the order of Melchiſedech;</hi> and this is
the end of his life in heaven. That as in the Old
Law the High-prieſt (Chriſts type in this) <hi>ought
to offer up the ſacrifice</hi> of every one that came unto
God by him, (as HEB. 5. 5.) in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Chriſt; for it is <hi>his calling,</hi> (as you have it,
<hi>ver.</hi> 6.) Otherwiſe, as that woman ſaid to
<hi>Philip,</hi> when ſhe came to him for juſtice, and he
put her off, <hi>Then ceaſe</hi> (ſayes ſhe) <hi>to be a King:</hi> So
if Chriſt ſhould deny any ſuch ſoule to take its
cauſe in hand, he muſt then <hi>ceaſe to be a Prieſt.
He lives to intercede: He is a Prieſt called by God, as was
Aaron, ver.</hi> 6. Wherefore he <hi>ought</hi> to doe it, in
that it is his <hi>office.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. And if thy ſoule yet feareth the difficulty
of its owne particular caſe, in reſpect of the
greatneſſe of thy ſinnes, and the circumſtances
thereof, or any conſideration whatſoever which
to thy view doth make thy ſalvation an hard
ſuit to obtaine: the Apoſtle therefore further
addes, [<hi>He is able to ſave to the utmoſt</hi>] (what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thy cauſe be) and this, through this his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion.
That ſame word [<hi>to the utmoſt</hi>] is a
good word, and vvell put in for our comfort.
Conſider it therefore, for it is a reaching vvord,
and extends it ſelfe ſo farre, that thou canſt not
look beyond it. Let thy ſoule be ſet upon the
higheſt mount that ever any creature vvas yet
ſet upon, and that is enlarged to take in and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:155276:117"/>
view the moſt ſpacious proſpect both of ſinne and
miſery, and difficulties of being ſaved, that ever
yet any poore humbled ſoule did caſt within it
ſelfe: yea joyne to theſe all the objections and
hinderances of thy Salvation that the heart of
man can ſuppoſe or invent againſt it ſelfe: lift up
thy eyes and looke to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> thou canſt ſee,
and Chriſt by his Interceſſion is able to ſave thee
beyond the Horizon and furtheſt compaſſe of
thy thoughts, even <hi>to the utmoſt</hi> and worſt caſe
the heart of Man can ſuppoſe. It is not thy having
<hi>laine long</hi> in Sinne, <hi>long</hi> under <hi>terrours</hi> and <hi>deſpairs,</hi>
or having ſinned <hi>often</hi> after many enlightnings,
that can hinder thee from being ſaved by Chriſt.
Do but remember this ſame word [<hi>to the utmoſt,</hi>]
and then put in what exceptions thou wilt or
canſt, lay all the barrs in thy way that are ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable;
yet know thou that the gates of Hell
<hi>ſhall not prevail againſt thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Again, conſider but what it is <hi>that</hi> Chriſt,
who hath by his death done enough to ſave thee,
doth yet further for thee in Heaven. If thou
thoughteſt thou hadſt all the Saints in Heaven
and Earth jointly concurring in promoving thy
ſalvation, and competitours unto God in inſtant
and inceſſant requeſts and prayers to ſave thee;
how wouldeſt thou be encouraged? (ſhall I tell
thee?) one word out of Chriſts mouth (who is
the <hi>King of Saints</hi>) will do more then all in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth can doe: and what is there then
which we may not hope to obtain through his
Interceſſion?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:155276:117"/>
And wouldſt thou know whether he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
thy cauſe, and begun to intercede for thee?
In a word, Hath he put his ſpirit into thy heart,
and ſet thy own heart on work to make inceſſant
Interceſſions for thy ſelfe <hi>with groans unutterable?</hi>
(as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.) This is the Eccho
of Chriſts Interceſſion for thee in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>5. (And laſtly) If ſuch a ſoule ſhall further
object, But will he not give over ſuing for me?
may I not be caſt out of his prayers through my
unbeliefe? Let it here be conſidered, that he
lives [<hi>ever</hi>] to intercede: And therefore if he
once undertake thy cauſe, and getteth thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his prayers, he will never leave thee out night
nor day. He Intercedeth ever, till he hath accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht
and finiſhed thy ſalvation. Men have been
caſt out of good and holy mens prayers, as <hi>Saul</hi>
out of <hi>Samuels,</hi> and the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remies;</hi>
but never out of Chriſts prayers; the <hi>ſmoak
of his Incenſe aſcends for ever,</hi> and he will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
to the utmoſt, till he hath ſaved thee to the
utmoſt. He will never give over, but will lye in
the duſt for thee, or he will perfect and procure
thy <hi>Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Onely whilſt I am thus raiſing up your Faith to
him upon the worke of his Interceſſion for us; let
me ſpeak a word to you for him, ſo to ſtir up your
love to him, upon the conſideration of this his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
alſo. You ſee you have the whole life of
Chriſt firſt and laſt, both here and in heaven laid
out for you: He had not come to earth but for you:
he had no other buſineſſe here; <hi>Vnto us a Son is born.</hi>
                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:155276:118"/>
And (to be ſure) he had not dyed but <hi>for you: (for
us a Son was given</hi>) and when he <hi>roſe,</hi> it was <hi>for your
juſtification:</hi> And now he is gone to heaven, he
<hi>lives</hi> but to <hi>intercede</hi> for you. He makes your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
his conſtant calling. O therefore let us
live wholly unto him, for he hath, and doth
live wholly unto us. You have his whole time
among you; and if he were your ſervant, you
could deſire no more. There was much of your
time loſt before you began to live to him: but
there hath beene no moment of his time which
he hath not lived to, and improved for you. Nor
are you able <hi>ever</hi> to live for him, but onely in
this life, for hereafter you ſhall live with him,
and be glorified of him. I conclude all with that
of the Apoſtle, <hi>The love of Chriſt</hi> it ſhould <hi>conſtraine</hi>
us, becauſe we cannot but <hi>judge</hi> this to be the
moſt equall, that <hi>they which live ſhould not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
live unto themſelves, but unto him who dyed for
them, and roſe again;</hi> and (out of the Text I alſo
adde) <hi>ſits at Gods right hand;</hi> yea, and there <hi>lives
for ever to make Interceſsion for us.</hi>

<list>
                                       <item>1. This affection of compaſſion is not wholly to be
underſtood in a <hi>Metaphoricall</hi> ſenſe, as
when God is ſaid to be afflicted, &amp;c. that is,
not meerely after the ſimilitude of men, but
in a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>reall</hi> ſenſe. 111</item>

more like to ours then thoſe which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells

analogicall to ours. 113</item>
                                       <item>3 Chriſt having taken fraile fleſh ere he went to
Heaven, this fits him yet more for having

towards ſinners on earth that doe come to

The ſcope and uſe whereof will be this, To
hearten and encourage Beleevers to come more
boldly unto the Throne of Grace, unto ſuch a
Saviour and High-prieſt, when they ſhall know
how ſweetly and tenderly his heart (though he
is now in his glory) is inclined towards them;
and ſo to remove that great ſtone of ſtumbling
which we meet with, (and yet lyeth unſeen) in the
thoughts of men in the way to faith, that Chriſt
being now abſent, and withall exalted to ſo
high and infinite a diſtance of glory, as to <hi>ſit
at Gods right hand, &amp;c.</hi> they therefore cannot
tell how to come to treat with him about their
ſalvation ſo freely, and with that hopefulneſſe
to obtaine, as thoſe poore ſinners did, who
were here on earth with him: Had our lot been
(think they) but to have converſed with him
(in the dayes of his fleſh) as <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and
his other Diſciples did here below, wee could
have thought to have beene bold with him, and
have been familiar with him, and to have had
any thing at his hands; For they beheld him afore
them, a man like unto themſelves, and he was
full of meekneſſe, and gentleneſſe, he being then
himſelfe made ſinne, and ſenſible of all ſorts
of miſeries; but now he is gone into a farre
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155276:124"/>
Countrey, and hath put on glory and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and how his heart may be altered thereby
we know not. The drift of this Diſcourſe is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to aſcertaine poore ſoules, that his <hi>Heart</hi> (in
reſpect of pity and compaſſion) remains the ſame
it was on earth; that he intercedes there with the

meek, as gentle, as eaſie to be entreated, as
tender in his bowels; ſo that they may deale with
him as fairely about the great matter of their

tearmes obtaine it of him, as they might if
they had beene on earth with him, and be as
familiar with him in all their requeſts, as bold

ſumme of all.<note place="margin">1. Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from his carriage at his laſt fare-well.</note> The Preface is this, [<hi>Before the
Feaſt of the Paſſeover, when Ieſus knew that his houre
was come, that he ſhould depart out of this world unto
the Father, having loved his owne which were in the
world, he loved them unto the end. And ſupper being
ended,—Ieſus knowing that the Father had given
all things into his hands, and that he was come from
God, and went to God, he then waſhed his Diſciples
feet.</hi>] Now this Preface was prefixed by the
Euangeliſt, on purpoſe to ſet open a window in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſts heart, to ſhew what it was then at his
departure, and ſo withall to give a light into,
and put a gloſſe and interpretation upon all that
followes: The ſcope whereof is to ſhew what
his affections would be to them in heaven; He
tels us what Chriſts <hi>thoughts</hi> were then, and what
was his <hi>heart</hi> amidſt thoſe thoughts, (both which
occaſioned all that ſucceeds.)</p>
                        <p>1. He premiſeth what was in Chriſts thoughts
and his meditation: He began deeply to conſider,
both that he was to depart out of this world,
(<hi>Ieſus knew, &amp;c.</hi> (ſayes the Text) that is, was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155276:126"/>
then thinking of it) <hi>that he ſhould depart unto the
Father,</hi> and how that then he ſhould ſhortly be
inſtalled into that glory which was due unto
him; ſo it followes, <hi>ver. 3. Ieſus knowing</hi> (that
is, was then actually taking into his mind) <hi>that
the Father had given all things into his hands,</hi> that
is, that all power in heaven and earth was his,
ſo ſoone as he ſhould ſet footing in heaven; then
in the midſt of theſe thoughts he tells us, he went
and waſhed his Diſciples feet, (after he had firſt
conſidered whither he was to goe, and there,
what he was to be.)</p>
                        <p>But ſecondly, what was Chriſts <hi>Heart</hi> moſt
upon, in the midſt of all theſe elevated medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
Not upon his own glory ſo much, (though
it is told us that he conſidered that, thereby the

                           </gap>] the word ſhews
that he reckon them <hi>his owne</hi> but as goods, not as
perſons) but he cals theſe here <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, his own by
a nearer propriety, that is, his owne <hi>children,</hi> his
owne <hi>members,</hi> his owne <hi>wife,</hi> his owne <hi>fleſh:</hi>
and he conſiders, that though he was to goe out
of the world, yet they were to be in the world;
and therefore it is on purpoſe added, <hi>which were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155276:127"/>
in the world,</hi> that is, to remaine in this world.
Hee had others of his own who were in that
world unto which he was going, even the <hi>ſpirits
of juſt men made perfect,</hi> (whom as yet he had never
ſeene.) One would think, that when he was medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
upon his going out of this world, his heart
ſhould be all upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> his <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> and his
<hi>Iacobs,</hi> whom he was going to; no, hee takes
more care for his own, who vvere to remain here
in this vvorld, a <hi>world</hi> wherein there is much
<hi>evil,</hi> (as himſelfe ſayes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 15.) both of ſinne
and miſerie, and vvith which, themſelves vvhilſt
in it, could not but be defiled and vexed. This is
it vvhich draws out his bowels towards them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at that time vvhen his heart was full of the
thoughts of his own glory: <hi>Having loved his own,
he loved them unto the end.</hi> Which is ſpoken, to ſhew
the conſtancie of his love, and vvhat it vvould
be when Chriſt ſhould be in his glory. [<hi>To the end</hi>]
that is, to the <hi>perfection</hi> of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, ſayes <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome:</hi>
having begun to love them, he vvill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and conſummate his love to them. And <hi>to
the end,</hi> that is, [<hi>forever;</hi>] So in the Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>
is ſometimes uſed, and ſo by the Euangeliſt the
phraſe is here uſed in a ſutableneſſe to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
phraſe, <hi>Pſal. 103. 9. He will not alwayes chide,
nor reſerve anger [for ever;</hi>] ſo we tranſlate it, but
in the Originall, <hi>He reſerves not anger [unto the end.</hi>]
So that the ſcope of this ſpeech is to ſhew how
Chriſts heart and love vvould be towards them
even <hi>for ever,</hi> when he ſhould be gone unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as well as it vvas to ſhew how it had beene
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:155276:127"/>
here on earth; they being his <hi>owne,</hi> and hee <hi>having
loved</hi> them, he alters, he changes not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vvill love them for ever.</p>
                        <p>And then thirdly, to teſtifie thus much by a reall
teſtimony, what his love would be, when in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to them, the Euangeliſt ſhews, that when he
was in the middeſt of all thoſe great thoughts
of his approaching glory, and of the ſoveraigne
eſtate which he was to be in, he then tooke wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and a towell, and waſhed his Diſciples feete.
This to have bin his ſcope will appeare, if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
but the coherence in the ſecond verſe, it is
ſaid, that <hi>Ieſus knowing that the Father had given all
things into his hands,</hi> then (ver. 4.) <hi>he riſeth from
ſupper, and layes aſide his garments, and tooke a towel
and girded himſelfe;</hi> (ver. 5.) after that, <hi>he powred
water into a baſon, and began to waſh his Diſciples feete,
&amp;c.</hi> where it is evident that the Euangeliſts ſcope is
to hold forth this unto us, that then when Chriſts
thoughts were full of his glorie, &amp; when he tooke
in the conſideration of it unto the utmoſt; even
then, and upon that occaſion, and in the midſt of
thoſe thoughts, he waſht his Diſciples feete; And
what was Chriſts meaning in this, but that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
when he ſhould be in heaven, he could not make
ſuch outward viſible demonſtrations of his heart,
by doing ſuch meane ſervices for them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by doing this in the middeſt of ſuch thoughts
of his glory, hee would ſhew what hee could
be content (as it were) to doe for them, when
hee ſhould bee in full poſſeſſion of it? (ſo
great is his love unto them.) There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:155276:128"/>
expreſſion of Chriſts like unto this, in <hi>Luke</hi>
12. 36, 37. which confirms this to be his meaning
here, and to be his very heart in heaven. At <hi>ver.</hi>
36. he compares himſelfe to a <hi>Bridegroome,</hi>
who is to go to heaven unto a wedding-feaſt;
who hath ſervants on earth that ſtand all that
while here below, as without, waiting for him;
at which, becauſe they wait ſo long, they may
think much, Chriſt adds, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that
when the Bridegroome returnes</hi> (refreſhed with wine
and gladneſſe) <hi>he ſhall gird himſelfe, and make them
ſit downe to meate; and will come forth and [ſerve
them.</hi>] The meaning is not as if that Chriſt ſerved
at the latter day, or now in heaven, thoſe that ſit
downe there; but onely it is an abundant expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in words, as here, in a real inſtance to ſet forth
the over-flowing love that is in his heart, and
the tranſcendent happineſſe that we ſhal then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
even beyond what can be expected by us,
(he utters himſelfe therefore by an unwonted
thing not heard of, that the Lord ſhould ſerve his
ſervants, and wait on them that waited for him)
And it is to ſhew his heart to them, and vvhat
he could be contented to doe for them. So that
you ſee what his heart was before he went to
Heaven, even amidſt the thoughts of all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and you ſee vvhat it is after he hath beene
in heaven, and greatned vvith all his glory,
even content to waſh poore ſinners feete, and
to ſerve them that come to him and wait for
him.</p>
                        <p>Now fourthly, what was the myſtery of this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:155276:128"/>
his <hi>waſhing their feete?</hi> It was, as to give them an
example of mutuall love and humility, ſo to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
his waſhing away their ſins: thus <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and
10. himſelfe interprets it. It is true indeede, that
now he is in heaven, he cannot come to waſh
the feete of their bodies, but he would ſignifie
thus much thereby, that thoſe ſinners that will
come to him when in his glory, he will waſh away
all their ſins: <hi>He loved his Church, &amp; gave himſelf for
it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the [waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of water,] that he might preſent it to himſelf a
glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, &amp;c.</hi> Eph.
5. 25, 26, 27.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>ſpecimen</hi> or declaration of his mind,
wee have from this his carriage, at this his
laſt farewell. Let us next take a ſurvey of
the drift of that long Sermon which hee
made at that his farewell, and wee ſhall find
the maine ſcope of it to be further to aſſure
his Diſciples of what his Heart would be unto
them, and that will make a ſecond Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
                        <p>It were too long a work to inſiſt upon each
particular:<note place="margin">2. From many paſſages in that laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> But certainly, no loving Husband
ever endeavoured more to ſatisfie the heart of
his Spouſe during his abſence, then Chriſt doth
his Diſciples hearts, and in them, all Beleevers:
(For take that along, once for all, that what
Chriſt ſaid unto them, he ſayes unto us, as in
that 17. of <hi>Iohn</hi> that ſpeech implyes, <hi>I pray not
for them onely, but for thoſe alſo that ſhall beleeve
through their word.</hi>) And as what he prayed for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:155276:129"/>
them was for all Beleevers alſo; ſo what he then
ſpake unto them.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, he lets them ſee what his heart would be
unto them, and how mindfull of them when in
heaven, by that <hi>buſineſſe</hi> which he profeſſeth hee
vvent thither to performe for them: concerning
which, obſerve firſt, that he lovingly acquaints
them with it afore-hand what it is, which argued
care and tenderneſſe, as from an husband unto a
vvife it doth; And vvithall, hovv plaine hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth he ſpeak, as one that vvould not hide any
thing from them? <hi>Ioh. 16. 7. I tell you the truth</hi> of it,
(ſayes he) <hi>it is expedient</hi> (and expedient) <hi>for you, that
I goe away.</hi> And ſecondly, he tels them, it is wholly
for them and their happineſſe; <hi>I goe to ſend you a
Comforter,</hi> whilſt you are in this world, &amp; <hi>to prepare
a place for you, (Iohn</hi> 14. 2.) when you ſhall goe out
of this world: <hi>There are many manſions in my Fathers
houſe,</hi> and I goe to take them up for you, &amp; to keep
your places for you till you come. And there
againe, how openly and candidly doth he ſpeak
to them? <hi>If it had beene otherwiſe,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>I
would have told you:</hi> You may beleeve me, I would
not deceive you for all the glory in that place
to which I am a going. Whom would not this
openneſſe and nakedneſſe of heart perſwade?
But then thirdly, the <hi>buſineſſe</hi> it ſelfe being
ſuch as is ſo much for us and our happineſſe;
how much more doth that argue it? And indeed,
Chriſt himſelfe doth fetch from thence an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the continuance of his love to them.
So <hi>ver. 3. If I goe to prepare a place for you,</hi> (if that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:155276:129"/>
be my errand) then doubt not of my love when
I am there; All the glory of the place ſhall never
make me forget my buſineſſe. When he was on
earth, he forgot none of the buſineſſe for which
he came into the World: Shall <hi>I not doe my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
buſineſse?</hi> (ſayd he, when he was a child)
yes, and he did it to the utmoſt, by <hi>fulfilling all
righteouſneſſe.</hi> Surely therefore he will not forget
any of that buſineſſe which he is to do in heaven,
it being the more pleaſant work by far. And (as I
ſhewed in the former diſcourſe, out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 20.)
<hi>He is entred as a Fore-runner,</hi> an Harbinger, to take
up places there for us, and if he could forget us,
yet our names are all written in heaven round
about him, &amp; are continually afore his eyes writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
there, not onely by Gods election, ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
23. <hi>Ye are come to mount Sion, and to the heavenly Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
and to the Church of the firſt-borne [which are
written in heaven;] and to Ieſus, and to the bloud of
ſprinkling, &amp;c.</hi> but Chriſt himſelfe ſcores them up
anew with his bloud, over every manſion there,
which he takes up for any. Yea, he carryeth their
names written in his heart, as the High-prieſt did
the names of the ten Tribes on his breaſt, when
he entred into the Holy of Holies. He ſits in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to ſee to it, that none other ſhould take their
roomes over their heads, (as we ſay) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Salvation is ſaid to <hi>be reſerved
in Heaven for them,</hi> that is, kept on purpoſe for
them by Jeſus Chriſt. The evill Angels had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
there once, but they were diſpoſed of unto
others over their heads, as the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>
                           <pb n="14" facs="tcp:155276:130"/>
vvas from the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> the reaſon of vvhich
vvas, becauſe they had not a Chriſt there to
intercede for them, as vve have.</p>
                        <p>Then ſecondly, to manifeſt his mind fulneſſe
of them, and of all beleevers elſe, when he ſhould
be in his glory, he tels them that when he hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
that buſines for them, and made Heaven
ready for them, and all the elect that are to come,
that then he meanes to come again to them: So
<hi>Chap. 14. ver. 3. If I goe and prepare a place for you,
I will come again,</hi> vvhich is a meere expreſſion of
love, for he if he had pleaſed, he might have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it to have ſent for them to him, but <hi>he means
to come for them himſelfe,</hi> and this vvhen he is warm
(as vve ſpeake) and in the height and midſt of
his glory in Heaven, yet he vvill for a time leave
it to come again unto his Spouſe: And what is it
for? 1. To ſee her; [<hi>I will ſee you again,</hi>] and
your heart ſhall rejoyce. 2. To fetch her; So
<hi>Iohn. 14. 3. I will come again and receive you to my ſelfe.</hi>
He condeſcends to the very laws of Bridegrooms;
(for notwithſtanding all his greatneſſe, no Lover
ſhall put him down in any expreſſion of true love)
It is the manner of Bridegrooms, when they have
made all ready in their Fathers houſe, then to
come themſelves and fetch their Brides, and not
to ſend for them by others, becauſe it is a time of
love. Love deſcends, better then aſcends; and ſo
doth the love of Chriſt, who indeed is Love it
ſelf; &amp; therefore comes down to us himſelf: <hi>I will
come again and receive you unto my ſelf,</hi> (ſayes Chriſt)
<hi>that ſo where I am, you may be alſo.</hi> That laſt part of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:155276:130"/>
his ſpeech gives the reaſon of it, and withall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayes
his entire affection: It is as if he had ſaid,
The truth is, I cannot live without you; I ſhall
never be quiet till I have you where I am, that
ſo vve may never part againe, (that is the reaſon
of it.) Heaven ſhall not hold me, nor my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
company, if I have not you with me, my
heart is ſo ſet upon you: And if I have any glory,
you ſhall have part of it. So <hi>ver. 19. Becauſe I live,
you ſhall live alſo.</hi> It is a reaſon, and it is halfe an
oath beſides; [<hi>As I live</hi>] is Gods oath; [<hi>Becauſe
I live</hi>] ſayes Chriſt; He pawnes his life upon it,
and deſires to live upon no other tearmes; [<hi>He
ſhall live to ſee his ſeed, &amp;c. Eſay</hi> 53.] And yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the more to expreſſe the workings and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his heart after them all that while, he tels
them, it ſhall not be long neither ere he doth
come againe to them. So <hi>Iohn 16. 16. Againe a
little while and ye ſhall ſee me; a little while and ye
ſhall not ſee me,</hi> (ſayes he.) Which [not ſeeing him]
refers not to that ſmall ſpace of abſence whilſt
dead and in the grave; but of that after his laſt
aſcending, forty dayes after his Reſurrection,
when he ſhould goe away, not to be ſeene on
earth againe untill the day of Judgement; and
yet from that Aſcenſion <hi>but a little while</hi> (ſayes
he) <hi>and you ſhall ſee me againe;</hi> namely, at the day
of Judgement. It is ſaid, <hi>Heb. 10. 37. Yet a little
while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not
tarry.</hi> The words in the Greek are, [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,]
<hi>A little little as may be:</hi>
Though long for the time in it ſelfe, yet as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:155276:131"/>
while as may be in reſpect of his deſire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt delaying to come: He will ſtay not
a moment longer, then till he hath diſpatcht all
our buſineſſe there for us. And then the doubling
of the phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, (<hi>Veniens veniet, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
he will come</hi>) implyes vehemencie of deſire
to come, and that his mind is alwayes upon it;
he is ſtill <hi>a comming;</hi> he can hardly be kept away.
Thus the Hebrew phraſe likewiſe ſignifies an
urgencie, vehemencie, and intenſeneſſe of ſome
act; as [<hi>Expecting I have expected; Deſiring I have
deſired;</hi>] ſo [<hi>Comming he will come:</hi>] And as not
content with theſe expreſſions of deſire, hee
adds over and above all theſe, [<hi>And will not
tarry,</hi>] and all to ſignifie the infinite ardencie of
his mind towards his Elect below, and to have
all his Elect in heaven about him. He will not
ſtay a minute longer then needs muſt; he tarryes
onely till he hath throughout all Ages by his
Interceſſion prepared every room for each Saint,
that he may entertaine them all at once toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and have them all about him.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, what his heart would be towards
them in his abſence, he expreſſeth by the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
proviſion hee makes, and the order hee
takes for their comfort in his abſence. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.
18. <hi>I will not leave you as Orphanes,</hi> (ſo the word is)
I will not leave you like father-leſſe and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
children at ſixes and ſevens. My Father and
I have but one onely friend who lyes in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
of us both, and proceedeth from us both,
the holy Ghoſt, and in the meane time I will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:155276:131"/>
ſend him to you. Doing herein as a loving Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
uſeth to doe in his abſence, even commit
his Wife to the deareſt friend he hath; ſo doth
Chriſt. <hi>Ver. 16. I will pray the Father,</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>and he ſhall give you another Comforter:</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi>
16. 7. he ſaith, <hi>I will ſend him to you.</hi> Who</p>
                        <p>Firſt, ſhall be a better Comforter unto you
then I am to be in this kind of diſpenſation, (which
whilſt I am on earth, I am bound up towards you
in) So in that 16. of <hi>Iohn, ver.</hi> 7. he intimates, <hi>It
is expedient</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that I goe away; for if I goe
not away, the Comforter will not come;</hi> who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his office, will comfort you bettet then I
ſhould doe with my bodily preſence. And this
Spirit, as he is the <hi>earneſt of heaven,</hi> (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeaks) ſo he is the greateſt token &amp; pledge
of Chriſts love that ever was; and ſuch a one as
<hi>the world cannot receive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And yet ſecondly, all the comfort he ſhall
ſpeak to you all that while, will be but from the
expreſſion of my heart towards you: For as he
comes not of himſelfe, but <hi>I muſt ſend him, (Ioh.</hi>
16. 7.) ſo <hi>he will ſpeake nothing of himſelfe,</hi> but
<hi>whatſoever he ſhall heare, that ſhall he ſpeake, (ver.</hi> 13.)
And <hi>ver.</hi> 14. he ſayes, <hi>He ſhall receive of mine, and
ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi> Him therefore I ſhall ſend on
purpoſe to be in my roome, and to execute my
place to you my Bride, Spouſe, and he ſhall tell
you (if you will liſten to him, and not grieve
him) nothing but ſtories of my love: So it is
there, <hi>He ſhall glorifie me,</hi> namely, to you, (for I
am in my ſelfe already glorified in heaven.) All
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:155276:132"/>
his ſpeech in your hearts will be to advance me,
and to greaten my worth and love unto you;
and it will be his delight to doe it: And he can
come from heaven in an inſtant when he will, and
bring you freſh tidings of my mind, and tell you
the thoughts I laſt had of you, even at that very
minute when I am thinking of them, what they
are at the very time wherein he tells you them.
(And therefore in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. by <hi>having the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
ver.</hi> 12. we are ſaid to <hi>have the mind of Chriſt,
ver. ult.</hi>) For he dwelleth in Chriſts heart, and alſo
ours, and lifts up from one hand to the other
what Chriſts thoughts are to us, and what our
prayers and faith are to Chriſt.) So that you ſhall
have my heart as ſurely and as ſpeedily as if I
were with you; and he will continually be brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
your hearts, either with my love to you, or
yours to me, or both; and if either, you may be
ſure of my love thereby. And whereas (ſayes he)
you have the Spirit now in your hearts, ſo <hi>ver.</hi>
17. of <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. [<hi>He now dwels in you,</hi>] yet after
my Aſcenſion, <hi>he ſhall be</hi> in a further meaſure <hi>in
you,</hi> as it follows there: And <hi>at that day</hi> (ver. 20.)
<hi>you ſhall know</hi> (namely, by his Dictate) <hi>that I am in
my Father, and you in me, and I in you:</hi> He will tell you
when I am in Heaven, that there is as true a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
between me and you, and as true a dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of affection in me towards you, as is between
my Father and me; and that it is as impoſſible to
breake this knot, and to take off my heart from
you, as my Fathers from me, or mine from my
Father.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="19" facs="tcp:155276:132"/>
And then thirdly, you ſhall be ſure, that what
he ſayes of my love to you, is true; <hi>for he is the
Spirit of truth, Chap. 16. ver.</hi> 13. as alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.
<hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. (which Chriſt ſpeaks of him as he is a
Comforter.) And as you beleeve me when I tell
you of my Father, becauſe I come from him, ſo
you may beleeve him in all that hee ſayes of
mee and of my love to you, for hee comes
from me.</p>
                        <p>Ay but might they ſay, Will not hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
leave us for a time, as you have done? No,
ſayes Chriſt, <hi>Chap. 14. 16. The Father ſhall give
you another Comforter, and he ſhall abide with you for
ever:</hi> Chriſt ſpeakes it in oppoſition to himſelfe;
He himſelfe had beene a Comforter unto them,
but he was now to be abſent, but not ſo the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
<hi>He ſhall be with you for ever:</hi> and as he is <hi>now
with you,</hi> ſo he <hi>ſhall be in you,</hi> ver. 17.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth place, if this be not enough to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
them how his heart would bee affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, he aſſures them he will give them
daily experience of it. Doe but try me (ſayes he)
vvhen I am gone, and that by ſending me vvord
upon all occaſions, vvhat you vvould have mee
to doe for you, (and I have left my Spirit to be
your Secretary, and the Enditer of all your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
<hi>Hitherto you have asked nothing</hi> (that is, little)
<hi>in my name,</hi> (he blames them that they have asked
him no more to doe for them) <hi>but now ask and you
ſhall receive.</hi> And if otherwiſe you vvill not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
yet you ſhall beleeve your own eyes; ask &amp;
you ſhall ſee your ſelves anſwered preſently:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:155276:133"/>
and ſo <hi>Beleeve me</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>for the very works ſake,
Ioh.</hi> 14. 11. He ſpeaks it of the works he would do
for them, in anſwer to their prayers when hee
was gone; which ſhould be as ſo many Epiſtles
of his heart, returned in anſwer unto theirs: For
it follows, <hi>ver. 12. Hee that beleeveth on me ſhall do
greater works then I, becauſe I goe to my Father.</hi> So
that it is manifeſt, he ſpeakes of the works done
after his Aſcenſion. And how vvere they to get
and procure them to be done? By Prayer; ſo it
follows, <hi>ver. 13. And whatſoever you ſhall ask in my
name, that will I doe.</hi> Hee ſpeakes it of the time
when he is gone. And again he ſayes in <hi>ver.</hi> 14.
<hi>If you ſhall ask any thing in my name, I will doe it.</hi> Let
me but heare from you, be it every weeke, every
day, every houre, you ſhall be ſure of an anſwer,
(<hi>Open your mouthes wide, &amp; I will fill them</hi>) And thoſe
your Prayers ſhall be as continuall tokens both of
your hearts towards me, and my anſwers ſhall be
the like of mine to you. And becauſe Chriſt bids
them direct (their Letters) their Prayers to the
Father, onely to ſend them in his name, as <hi>Iohn</hi>
16. 23. and ſo they might perhaps not ſo cleerly
know and diſcern that his heart was in the anſwer
to them, but his Fathers hand onely, therefore
hee adds twice in the 14. of <hi>Iohn, [I will doe it, I
will doe it.</hi>] He ſpeakes like one as forward to doe
for them, as his Father is or ſhould be; and as
deſirous to have them knovv and take notice of
his hand in it: And it is as if he had ſaid, Though
you ask the Father in my name, yet all comes
through my hands, and <hi>I will doe it:</hi> there muſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:155276:133"/>
be my hand to the warrant for every thing that is
done, and my heart ſhall not be wanting.</p>
                        <p>In the fift place, yet further to evidence his love,
he not onely bids them thus to pray to him, and in
his name upon all occaſions, but he aſſureth
them, that he himſelfe will pray for them: and
obſerve but the manner of his telling them this;
it is in the moſt inſinuating, perſwaſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
to convey his heart in to them, that
men uſe to utter, when they would intimate the
deepeſt care and purpoſe to doe a thing. <hi>Chap.</hi>
16. 26. <hi>At that day</hi> (namely, after his Aſcenſion)
<hi>ye ſhall ask, &amp;c.</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and I ſay not unto you,
that I will pray the Father for you;</hi> no, not I. (I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
it afore, I wil but add this illuſtration to it.)
It is ſuch a ſpeech as men uſe, when they would
expreſſe the greateſt reaſon that another hath,
to reſt confident and aſſured of their love; [<hi>I doe
not love you, no not I.</hi>] It is an expreſſing a thing by
its contrary, which is moſt emphaticall. As when
we ſay of a man, that hath the greateſt good turn
done him that can be, [You are ſhrewdly hurt:]
It is ſuch an expreſſion as <hi>Paul</hi> uſed to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians:</hi>
I converted your ſoules when you thought
not of it; <hi>I caught you with guile, [forgive mee this
wrong.</hi>] So ſayes Chriſt here, <hi>I ſay not that I will
pray for you,</hi> when the truth is, that it is the chiefeſt
work that he doth in heaven; <hi>He lives ever to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede:</hi>
as he ever lives, ſo to intercede ever, and
never to hold his peace till ſinners are ſaved. (But
<hi>the work of Chriſt in heaven</hi> is a ſubject deſerves
and will take up a diſtinct and large diſcourſe; I wil
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:155276:134"/>
therefore ſpeak no more of it now) neither will I
mention any more particulars out of this his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
Reade but over thoſe 3. Chapters, (the 14,
15, and 16.) for in them you have the longeſt
Sermon of his that is recorded; and he ſtood the
longeſt upon this theme, of any other, becauſe
indeed his heart was more in it, then in any point
that he ever preached on.</p>
                        <p>Onely if any object and ſay, He ſpake all
this to his Diſciples, to quiet and pacifie them,
and ſo, more in reſpect to their trouble, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
he would have ſpoken.</p>
                        <p>In the ſixt place, reade but the next Chapter,
(the 17.) and you ſhall ſee, that he preſently goes
apart and alone to his Father, and ſpeaks over all
again unto him, that which he had ſaid unto them.
He ſayes as much behind their backs <hi>of them,</hi> as
he had ſaid before their faces <hi>to them.</hi> Reade it,
and you will finde that he was the ſame abſent,
that preſent with them. He was therefore not
onely hearty in what he had ſaid, but his heart
was full of it. That Chapter (you know) contains
a Prayer put up juſt before his ſuffering, and there
he makes his Will, &amp; his laſt requeſt, for in ſuch a
ſtyle it runs, [<hi>Father, I will</hi>] ver. 24. which Will
he is gone to ſee executed in Heaven. And <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi>
ſaid true in that, that this Prayer is left us
by Chriſt, as a ſummary of his interceſſion for us
in Heaven; he ſpake as he meant to doe in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and as one that had done his worke, and was
now come to demand his wages; [<hi>I have finiſhed
thy work,</hi> (ſayes he, ver. 4) <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] And whereas he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:155276:134"/>
ſpeakes a word or two for himſelf, (in the firſt
5. verſes) he ſpeaks five times as many for them
for all the reſt of the Chapter is a Prayer for
them. He uſeth all kind of Arguments to move
his Father for his children: <hi>I have finiſhed the work
which thou gaveſt me to doe,</hi> (ſayes he) and to ſave
them is thy work, which remains to be done for
mee by thee: and <hi>they are thine, and thou gaveſt
them me;</hi> and I commend to thee but thine owne.
<hi>And all mine are thine, and thine are mine;</hi> He inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,
that he of himſelfe had not added a man,
but uſeth all his intereſt onely for thoſe that the
Father had given him: (and what a motive is
this?) and he profeſſeth he wil not open his mouth
for a man more: <hi>I pray not for the world,</hi> (ſayes he)
I will not open my lips for any one ſonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
but I employ all my Blood, my Prayers,
and my whole intereſt with thee, but for thoſe
thy ſelfe haſt given me. And (ſayes he) though
thou haſt given me a perſonall glory which
I had before the World was; yet there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
glory which I account of almoſt as much;
and that is in their being ſaved; <hi>I am glorifyed in
them,</hi> (ſayes he, ver. 10.) <hi>and they are my joy;</hi> (ver.
13.) and therefore, I muſt have them <hi>with mee
where ever I am:</hi> (ver. 24.) Thou haſt ſet my
heart upon them, and haſt loved them thy ſelfe,
as thou haſt loved me, and thou haſt ordained
them to be one in us, even as <hi>we are one,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I cannot live long aſunder from them: I
have thy company, but I muſt have theirs too;
<hi>I will that they be where I am,</hi> ver. 24. If I have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:155276:135"/>
any glory; they muſt have part of it: So it follows
in the fore-named verſe [<hi>That they may behold the
glory which thou haſt given me,</hi>] he ſpeakes all this
as if he had beene then in Heaven, and in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of all that glory, and therefore it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of his heart in Heaven, which you have
very good ground to build upon.</p>

                        <head type="sub">Demonſtrations from paſſages and expreſsions after his
Reſurrection.</head>
                        <p>THeſe Demonſtrations have beene taken
from his carriage and Sermon before his
death, even at his firſt breaking of his mind unto
his Diſciples concerning his departure from them.
Let us now take a view of our Saviour in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
after his <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> whence a further
<hi>Indicium</hi> of his heart, how it would ſtand towards
ſinners when he ſhould be in Heaven, may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and his love demonſtrated. For his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
was the firſt ſtep unto his Glory, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
an entrance into it; when hee laid downe
his bodie, he laid downe all earthly weakneſſes,
and paſſions of fleſh and blood. <hi>It was ſown</hi> (as ours
is) <hi>in weakneſſe;</hi> but with raiſing of it up again, he
took on him the diſpoſitions and qualifications of
an immortal and glorious body, <hi>It was raiſed in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</hi>
And <hi>The dayes of his fleſh</hi> (or frail eſtate) as the
Author to the Hebrews, by way of diſtinction
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:155276:135"/>
ſpeaks, were paſt and over at his Reſurrection:
and the garment of his body was new dyed, and
endowed with new qualities: and thereby it was
made of a ſtuffe fit to beare and ſuſtain Heavens
Glory: and therefore, what now his heart upon
his firſt riſing ſhall appeare to be towards us, will
be a certain demonſtration, what it will continue
to be in heaven. And to illuſtrate this the more,
conſider, that if ever there were a tryall taken,
whether his love to ſinners would continue or no,
it was then at his Reſurrection, for all his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
(eſpecially <hi>Peter</hi>) had carryed themſelves
the moſt unworthily towards him in that interim,
that could be; and this then when he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the greateſt act of love towards them,
(namely, dying for them) that ever was ſhewne
by any. (And by the way, ſo God often orders
it, that when hee is in hand with the greateſt
mercies for us, and bringing about our greateſt
good, then we are moſt of all ſinning againſt
him; which he doth, to magnifie his love the
more.) You know how they all forſook him,
and in the midſt of his Agonie in the Garden, (in
which he deſired their company, meerly for a
reliefe unto his ſadded ſpirit) they ſlept, and
lay like ſo many blocks, (utterly ſenſleſſe of his
dolours) which had they had any friendly ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie
of, they could never have done; [<hi>Could
you not watch with me one houre?</hi>] Then you
know, how foulely <hi>Peter</hi> denyed him with oathes
and curſes; and after that, when he was laid in
the grave, they are giving up all their faith in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:155276:136"/>
him, <hi>We truſted it ſhould have been he</hi> (ſay two of
them) <hi>that ſhould have redeemed Iſrael:</hi> They que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
whether he was the Meſſiah or no, <hi>Luke</hi>
24. 21. Now when Chriſt came firſt out of the
other world, from the dead, cloathed with that
heart and body which he was to weare in heaven,
what meſſage ſends he firſt to them? we would
all think, that as they would not know him in
his ſufferings, ſo he would now be as ſtrange to
them in his Glory: or at leaſt, his firſt words
ſhall be to rate them for their faithleſneſſe and
falſe-hood: but here is no ſuch matter; for <hi>Iohn</hi>
20. 17. his firſt word concerning them is, <hi>Goe tell
my Brethren, &amp;c.</hi> You reade elſewhere, how that
it is made a great point of love and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in Chriſt ſo to entitle them; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11.
[<hi>He is not aſhamed to call them Brethren</hi>] (ſurely his
brethren had beene aſhamed of him:) Now for
him to call them ſo when he was firſt entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his glory, argues the more love in him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. He caries it as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did in the height
of his advancement, when hee firſt brake his
minde to his brethren; <hi>I am</hi> Joſeph <hi>your brother</hi>
(ſayes he, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 4.) So Chriſt ſayes here, <hi>Tell
them</hi> you have ſeene <hi>Ieſus</hi> their <hi>Brother;</hi> I own
them as brethen ſtill. This was his firſt compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
but what was the meſſage that he would
firſt have delivered unto them? that I (ſayes he)
<hi>aſcend to my Father, and your Father.</hi> A more friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpeech by far, and arguing infinite more love
then that of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> did, (though that was full of
bowels) for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> after he had told them he was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:155276:136"/>
their <hi>brother,</hi> adds, [<hi>whom you ſold into Egypt,</hi>] he
minds them of their unkindneſſe, but not ſo
Chriſt, not a word of that, hee minds them not
of what they had done againſt him. Poore ſinners
who are full of the thoughts of their own ſinnes,
know not how they ſhall be able at the latter day
to looke Chriſt in the face when they ſhall firſt
meet with him: But they may relieve their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
againſt their care and feare, by Chriſts carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
now towards his Diſciples, who had ſo ſinned
againſt him: Be not afraid, <hi>your ſins will he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
no more.</hi> Yea further, you may obſerve, that
he minds them, not ſo much of what he had been
doing for them; He ſayes not, Tell them I have
been dying for them, or, That they little think
what I have ſuffered for them; not a word of that
neither: but ſtill his heart and his care is upon
doing more; he looks not backward to what is
paſt, but forgets his ſufferings, as <hi>a woman her
travaile, for joy that a man-child is borne.</hi> Having
now diſpatcht that great work on earth for
them, he haſtens to heaven as faſt as he can to
doe another: And though he knew he had buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
yet to doe upon earth, that would hold him
forty dayes longer; yet to ſhew that his heart
was longing, and eagerly deſirous to be at work
for them in heaven, hee ſpeakes in the preſent
tenſe, and tels them, <hi>I aſcend;</hi> and he expreſſeth
his joy to be, not onely that he <hi>goes to his Father,</hi>
but alſo that he goes to <hi>their Father,</hi> to be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
with him for them, of which I ſpake afore.
And is indeed Jeſus our Brother alive? and doth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:155276:137"/>
he call us Brethren? and doth he talk thus lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
of us? (whoſe heart would not this over
come?)</p>
                        <p>But this was but a meſſage ſent his Diſciples,
before he met them; let us next obſerve his
carriage and ſpeech at firſt meeting together.
When he came firſt amongſt them, this was his
ſalutation, <hi>Peace be to you, ver.</hi> 19. which he reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
<hi>ver.</hi> 21. and it is all one with that former
ſpeech of his uſed in that his parting Sermon,
[<hi>My peace I leave with you.</hi>] After this hee <hi>breathes
on them,</hi> and conveyes the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> in a further
meaſure into them, ſo to give an evidence of
what he would doe yet more plentifully in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
and the myſtery of that his <hi>breathing on them,</hi>
was to ſhew that this was the utmoſt expreſſion
of his heart, to give them the Spirit, and that it
came from the very bottome of it, (as a mans
breath doth) as well as that the holy Ghoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from him, as well as from the Father,
(which was alſo the meaning of it.) And to what
end doth he give them the Spirit? not for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
alone; but that they by the gifts and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of that Spirit might <hi>forgive mens ſins</hi> by
converting them to him, [<hi>Whoſe ſins ſoever ye remit,</hi>
(namely, by your miniſtery) <hi>they are remitted to
them:</hi>] His mind you ſee is ſtill upon ſinners, and
his care for the converſion of their ſoules. And
therefore in another Euangeliſt, (namely, <hi>Mark</hi>)
his laſt words recorded are theſe: <hi>Goe ye into all
the World, and preach the Goſpell unto every creature,
and he that beleeveth ſhall be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi> Chap. 16. 15.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:155276:137"/>
And in <hi>Luke,</hi> Chap. 24. ver. 46, 47. his laſt
words on earth there recorded are, [<hi>Thus it
behoved Chriſt to ſuffer and to riſe,—that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and remiſsion of ſinnes ſhould be preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all Nations,</hi> And addes, <hi>beginning at Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
where hee had beene but a few dayes
before crucified. Of all places, one would
have thought he would have excepted that, and
have charged them to paſſe by it, but he bids
them begin there: let them have the firſt fruit
and benefit by my death, that were the actors
in it. And (to that end) he alſo ſayes, <hi>Behold, I
ſend you the Promiſe of my Father, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 49. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time he appeares to two of them, and then
indeede he rates them, ſaying, <hi>O ye fools, and ſlow of
heart;</hi> but for what is it? but onely becauſe they
would not beleeve on him, for no other ſinne,
not for that they had forſaken him: ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>O ye fooles, and ſlow of heart to beleeve, &amp;c.
Luk.</hi> 24. 25. and this becauſe he is glad when
we beleeve, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 15. And after that, he
appeares to all the eleven, and <hi>upbraids</hi> them,
(the Text ſayes) but with what? with their <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe</hi>
and <hi>hardneſſe of heart;</hi> ſtill becauſe they
<hi>beleeved not,</hi> ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 14. No ſinne of theirs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him but their <hi>unbeliefe:</hi> Which ſhews how
his heart ſtands, in that he deſires nothing more,
then to have men beleeve in him; and this, now
when glorified. Afterwards he meets with <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
and ſcarce chides him for his groſſe unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe;
onely tels him, it was well that <hi>having
ſeene, he beleeved;</hi> but pronounceth them more

and ſo he is reproved, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 29. Another time
he ſhews himſelfe to his Diſciples, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
deales with <hi>Peter,</hi> but yet tels him not a
word of his ſins, nor of his forſaking of him, but
onely goes about to draw from him a teſtimony
of his love to himſelfe, <hi>Peter,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>loveſt
thou me?</hi> Chriſt loves to heare that note; full
well doe thoſe words ſound in his eares, when
you tell him, you love him, though he knows it
already; as <hi>Peter</hi> tels him, <hi>Thou knoweſt all things,
thou knoweſt I love thee, Iohn</hi> 21. 15. and this Chriſt
puts him thrice upon. And what was Chriſts
aime in drawing this acknowledgement of love
from <hi>Peter</hi> to him, but onely to put an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon <hi>Peter,</hi> that if he loved him as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
and would ever ſhew it, then to <hi>feed his
lambs?</hi> This is the great teſtimonie that he would
have <hi>Peter</hi> to ſhew his love in, when he ſhould be
in heaven; and this is the laſt charge he gives
him: Which how great a teſtimony is it, to ſhew
how his owne heart was affected, and what his
greateſt care was upon? His heart runs altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon his Lambs, upon ſoules to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
He had ſaid afore, <hi>Sheep I have, Iohn</hi> 10. 6.
<hi>which are not of this fold, them I muſt bring in:</hi>
(and he left his Apoſtles to doe it) but this here
was a more moving and affectionate expreſſion;
for ſheep can ſhift for themſelves, but poore lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Lambes cannot: Therefore Chriſt ſayes
unto <hi>Peter, Feed my Lambes,</hi> (even as <hi>Iohn,</hi> to
expreſſe the more love unto thoſe he writes to,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:155276:139"/>
calls them <hi>My little children.</hi>) And to what end doth
the Euangeliſt record theſe things of him after
his Reſurrection? One of the Euangeliſts that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
them, informs us; In the 20. of <hi>Iohn,
ver.</hi> 30. it is ſaid, that <hi>Ieſus did many other ſignes,</hi>
namely, after his Reſurrection: (for in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of the ſtory of thoſe things done after
his Reſurrection hee ſpeakes it,) <hi>which are
not written in this Book,</hi> (but partly recorded by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Euangeliſts, and partly concealed) <hi>but
theſe things are written that yee might beleeve
that</hi> JESVS <hi>is the</hi> CHRIST, that is, that
ſo you might come to him as to the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi>
the Saviour of the World: and therefore, the
moſt of the things recorded tend to ſhew Chriſts
heart and carriage towards Sinners, that ſo
wee might beleeve on him, and that <hi>beleeving
we might have life through his Name.</hi>

51. it is added, [<hi>And whilſt he bleſſed them, he was
parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</hi>] This
benediction Chriſt reſerved to be his laſt act;
and what was the meaning of it, but (as I have
before ſhewne) to bleſſe them, as God bleſſed
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> bidding them <hi>Encreaſe and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi>
and ſo bleſſing all Man-kind that were to
come of them? Thus doth Chriſt in bleſſing his
Diſciples, bleſſe all thoſe that ſhall beleeve
through their word unto the end of the world.
I only adde this to the illuſtration of it; this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
is interpreted by <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3. 26. when
ſpeaking to the Jews, he ſayes, <hi>Vnto you firſt, God
having raiſed up his Sonne Ieſus, ſent him [to bleſſe
you,</hi>] (and how?) <hi>in turning away every one of
you from his iniquities,</hi> and ſo, forgiving of them;
(for, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſin is forgiven.</hi>) Thus
at his aſcending.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, let us conſider what Chriſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:155276:140"/>
did when he was come to heaven and exalted
there: how abundantly did he there make good
all that he had promiſed in his laſt Sermon? For
Firſt, he inſtantly powred out his Spirit, and that
<hi>richly,</hi> (as the Apoſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> ſpeakes,) and he
<hi>being by the right hand of God exalted, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of the Father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, hee
hath ſhed forth this which you now ſee and heare,</hi> ſayes
the Apoſtle in his firſt Sermon after, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 33. he
then received it, and viſibly powred him out. So
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8. it is ſaid, <hi>He aſcended up on high, and
gave gifts unto men,—for the work of the Miniſtery,</hi>
(ver. 15) and <hi>for the joynting in of the Saints to the
encreaſe of the body of Chriſt,</hi> (ver. 16.) that is, for
the converting of elect ſinners, and making them
Saints. And the gifts there mentioned (ſome of
them) remain unto this day, in <hi>Paſtors, and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
&amp;c.</hi> And this ſpirit is ſtill in our preaching,
and in your hearts in hearing, in praying, &amp;c,
and perſwades you of Chriſts love to this very
day; and is in all theſe, the pledge of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Chriſts love ſtill, in Heaven unto ſinners.
All our Sermons and your Prayers are evidences
to you, that Chriſts heart is ſtill the ſame towards
ſinners, that ever it was, for the Spirit that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in all theſe, comes in his name, and in his
ſtead, and works all by commiſſion from him.
And doe none of you feele your hearts moved
in the preaching of theſe things, at this and other
times? and who is it that moves you? it is the
Spirit who ſpeakes in Chriſts name from heaven,
even as himſelfe is ſaid to <hi>ſpeake from heaven,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:155276:141"/>
Heb.</hi> 12. 25. And when you pray, it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that endites your prayers, and that <hi>makes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion
for you</hi> in your own hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.
which Interceſſion of his is but the evidence and
eccho of Chriſts Interceſſion in heaven. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
prayes in you, becauſe Chriſt prays for you:
he is an Interceſſor on earth, becauſe Chriſt is an
Interceſſor in Heaven. As he did take off Chriſts
words, and uſed the ſame that he before had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
vvhen he ſpake in and to the Diſciples the
vvords of life: ſo he takes off Chriſts prayers
alſo when he prayes in us: hee takes but the
vvords as it were out of Chriſts mouth, or heart
rather, and directs our hearts to offer them up to
God. He alſo follovvs us to the Sacrament, and
in that Glaſſe ſhews us Chriſts face ſmiling on us,
and through his face his heart; and thus helping
of us to a ſight of him, vve goe away rejoycing
that we ſavv our Saviour that day.</p>
                        <p>Then ſecondly, all thoſe vvorks both of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
and converſion of ſinners, in anſwer to the
Apoſtles prayers, are a demonſtration of this.
What a handſell had <hi>Peters</hi> firſt Sermon after
Chriſts Aſcenſion, when three thouſand ſoules
were converted by it? The Apoſtles (you know)
went on to preach forgiveneſſe through Chriſt,
and in his Name, and to invite men to him; and
what ſignes and wonders did accompany them,
to confirme that their preaching? and all were
the fruits of Chriſts Interceſſion in heaven: So
that what he promiſed, (<hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 12.) as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his minding them in heaven, was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:155276:141"/>
fulfilled. They <hi>upon their asking did grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
works then he:</hi> ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 29, 30. at the prayers
of <hi>Peter.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3, 4. the Apoſtle makes an
argument of it, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>if
we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began
to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us
by them that heard him, God alſo bearing them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
both with ſignes and wonders, and with divers
miracles? &amp;c.</hi> Yea, let me adde this, that take all
the New Teſtament, and all the Promiſes in it,
and expreſſions of Chriſts love, it was written
all ſince Chriſts being in heaven, by his Spirit,
and that by commiſſion from Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all that you find therein you may build on,
as his very heart; and therein ſee, that what he
once ſaid on earth, he repealeth not a word now
he is in heaven; his mind continues the ſame:
And the conſideration hereof may adde a great
confirmation to our faith herein.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, ſome of the Apoſtles ſpake with him
ſince, even many yeeres after his Aſcenſion.
Thus <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> (of which the laſt was in
heaven with him) and they both doe give out
the ſame thing of him. <hi>Paul</hi> heard not one Sermon
of Chriſts (that we know of) whilſt on earth,
and received the Goſpel from no man, Apoſtle,
or other, but by the immediate Revelation of
Jeſus Chriſt from heaven (as he ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.
11, 12.) But he was converted by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
from heaven, by immediate ſpeech and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Chriſt himſelfe with him; and this
long after his Aſcenſion. And in that one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:155276:142"/>
Chriſt abundantly ſhewed his heart and
purpoſe to continue to all ſorts of ſinners to the
end of the world. Thus in two places that
great Apoſtle telleth us; the firſt is 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi>
1. 13. <hi>I was a perſecuter, a blaſphemer,</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>but I obtained mercie, and the grace of our Lord</hi>
(namely, Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>was exceeding abundant:</hi>
and upon this, he declares with open mouth (as
it were) from Chriſts own ſelfe, who ſpake to
him from Heaven, that this is <hi>the faithfulleſt ſaying</hi>
that ever was uttered, <hi>that Chriſt came into the
World to ſave ſinners, whereof I am chiefe,</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>ver.</hi> 15. And to teſtifie that this was the very
ſcope of Chriſt in thus converting of <hi>Paul,</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
and <hi>Pauls</hi> ſcope alſo in that place to <hi>Timothy</hi>
to ſhew ſo much, appears by what follows, <hi>v.</hi> 16.
<hi>For this cauſe I obtained this mercie, that in me [firſt]
Ieſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering for a
pattern to all them that ſhould hereafter beleeve on him
unto life everlaſting.</hi> It is expreſſe (you ſee) to
aſſure all ſinners, unto the end of the world,
of Chriſt heart towards them: this was his
drift: <hi>For this very cauſe,</hi> (ſayes <hi>Paul.</hi>) The ſecond
place I alledge in proofe of this, is the ſtory of
<hi>Pauls</hi> converſion, where he diligently inſerts the
very words that Chriſt ſpake to him from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
(<hi>Acts</hi> 26. 16.) which were theſe, <hi>[I have
appeared unto thee for this purpoſe, to make thee a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
and a witneſſe,—to ſend thee to the Gentiles,
[to open their eyes, and to turne them from darkneſſe
to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that
they may receive forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:155276:142"/>
among them that are ſanctified by faith that is in
me.]</hi> Brethren, theſe are Chriſts words ſince he
went to Heaven, and he tels <hi>Paul</hi> hee appeared
unto him to teſtifie thus much. This for <hi>Pauls</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with him.</p>
                        <p>Then againe, ſixty yeares after his Aſcenſion,
did the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> receive a Revelation from
him, even when all the Apoſtles were dead, (for
after all their deaths was that book written) and
that Revelation is ſaid to be in a more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
manner, <hi>the Revelation of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> (ſo
<hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 1.) then any other of the Apoſtles wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:
and you read that Chriſt made an Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition
of himſelfe to him, and ſaid, <hi>I am he that was
dead, and am alive, and live for evermore, Chap.</hi> 1.
18. Now let us but conſider Chriſts laſt words,
in that his laſt book, (the laſt that Chriſt hath
ſpoken ſince he went to Heaven, or that hee is to
utter till the day of Judgement) you have them
in the laſt Chapter, <hi>ver. 16. I Ieſus have ſent mine.
Angel to teſtifie unto you theſe things in the Churches:
I am the root and the off-ſpring of</hi> David;—[<hi>and
the Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come: and let him that
heareth ſay, Come: and let him that is athirſt come:
and whoſoever will, let him take of the water of life
freely.</hi>] They are the latter words I cite this place
for; The occaſion of theſe words was this:
Chriſt was now in Heaven, and had before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
one day to come again, and fetch us all
to Heaven: And in the meane time, marke what
an ecchoing and anſwering of hearts and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
there is mutually betweene <hi>Him from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
                           <pb n="38" facs="tcp:155276:143"/>
and beleeving <hi>ſinners</hi> from below: <hi>Earth
calls</hi> upon <hi>Heaven,</hi> and Heaven calls upon earth,
as the Prophet ſpeaks. The <hi>Bride</hi> from earth ſayes
unto Chriſt, <hi>Come to me;</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the
Saints hearts below, ſayes, <hi>Come</hi> unto him alſo:
and Chriſt cryes out as loud from Heaven, <hi>Come,</hi>
in anſwer unto this deſire in them; ſo that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth ring againe of it. <hi>Let him that is
athirſt come to me; and let him that will come, come,
and take of the waters of life freely:</hi> This is Chriſt
ſpeech unto men on earth. They call him to
come unto earth, to Judgement; and he calls
ſinners to come up to heaven unto him for
mercie: They cannot deſire his comming to
them, ſo much as he deſires their comming
to him. Now what is the meaning of this, that
upon their calling upon him to come, he ſhould
thus call upon them to come? It is in effect as
if he had plainly uttered himſelfe thus, I have
a heart to come to you, but I muſt have all you
my Elect that are to be on earth, come to
me firſt: You would have me come downe to
you, but I muſt ſtay here, till all that the Father
hath given me, be come to me; and then you
ſhall be ſure, quickly to have me with you: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
expreſſing how much his heart now longs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them. This to be his meaning, is evident by
the words which he adds, <hi>ver. 20. He which teſtifies
theſe things,</hi> (namely, Chriſt) <hi>ſayes, [Surely I
come quickly.]</hi> And if we obſerve how much by
the by (as it were) theſe words of Chriſts doe
come in, it makes them the more remarkable to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:155276:143"/>
ſhew his heart in uttering them. This Book was
intended meerly as a Prophecie of the times of
the Goſpell untill his comming; unto which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of it, when <hi>Iohn</hi> had brought that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
ſtory, he brings in the Bride longing for
that comming of Chriſt, [<hi>The Bride ſayes, Come.</hi>]
And no ſooner ſayes ſhe ſo, but Chriſt by way of
retortion doth likewiſe ſay, <hi>Come,</hi> unto her alſo;
yea, it puts the more obſervation upon it, that he
had uttered the ſame words before, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 6.
but notwithſtanding he will repeate them again,
and have them to be his laſt words. All which
ſhews how much his heart was in this part of the
Goſpel, to invite ſinners to him; that now when
he is to ſpeake but one ſentence more, till wee
hear the ſound to judgement, he ſhould eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make choice of theſe words. Let them therfore
for ever ſtick with you, as being worthy to be your
laſt thoughts when you come to die, and when
you are a going to him. He ſpeakes indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe after them; but that which he ſayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
is but to ſet a ſeal unto theſe words, and
to the reſt of the Scriptures, whereof this is the
chiefe. And further to ſhew, that theſe words
vvere ſingled out to be his laſt, and that he meant
to ſpeak no more till the day of judgement, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo he adds a <hi>curſe</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> who ſhould <hi>adde
to them,</hi> or <hi>take from them.</hi> He adds indeed after
that another ſpeech, but it is onely to ingeminate
his willingneſſe to <hi>come quickly,</hi> were all his elect
but once come in to him, ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 20. And all
this tends to aſſure us that this is his heart, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:155276:144"/>
wee ſhall find him of no other minde untill his
comming again.</p>
                        <p>And that you may yet the more conſider them
as thus purpoſely brought in by him as his laſt
words to make them ſtick with us, let me adde
another obſervation about them, and that is this,
that at another time when he was upon earth, he in
like manner ſingled out theſe very words (I mean
the matter of them) as the concluſion and ſhutting
up of many dayes preaching. Thus <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 37.
<hi>In the laſt day, that great day of the Feaſt, Ieſus
ſtood and cryed, [If any man thirſt let him come
to me and drinke.</hi>] Theſe words were ſpoken on
the <hi>laſt day of the feaſt,</hi> after which hee vvas to
preach no more at that time, and for a good
vvhile after unto them: (and he had preached
upon all the former dayes of that feaſt, as his
manner vvas) and it vvas <hi>[the great] day of the
Feaſt,</hi> vvhen he had the greateſt audience: and
you ſee he chooſeth this for his laſt ſentence, of
tht his laſt Sermon then; and vvhen he vvould
give them ſomething at parting, as a <hi>Viaticum,</hi>
vvhich he would have them carry home vvith
them to feede upon above all the reſt, theſe are
his vvords, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come to mee,
and [drinke:]</hi> (which himſelf interprets to be
<hi>beleeving</hi> on him, <hi>ver.</hi> 38.) and he <hi>ſtands up</hi> to ſpeak
this; yea, <hi>he cries,</hi> ſayes the text, vvith open mouth,
with utmoſt vehemencie, to the intent that all
might heare this above all ſayings elſe. And
thus in like manner at this time alſo, when he is to
ſpeak no more, but to hold his tongue for ever till
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:155276:144"/>
the day of Judgement, (nor is to write any more
Scriptures) he then ſends his Angel to teſtifie
theſe to be his laſt words; and this, although
he had ſpoken them before: It was therefore
aſſuredly done, to ſhew his heart in them. They
were his laſt words then, and they ſhall
be mine in the cloſure of this
Diſcourſe, for vvhat can
there be added
to them?</p>

here calls by the name of <hi>Infirmities,</hi> thereby

                           <item>1. The <hi>evill of afflictions</hi> of what ſort ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

                     <p>And that both theſe are menat,</p>
                     <p>1. That under [<hi>Infirmities</hi>] he meanes perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
and afflictions is manifeſt, not only in that
the word is often uſed in that ſenſe, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 30.
and <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 5. but alſo it is plain, that the phraſe
is here ſo intended, for his ſcope is to comfort
them againſt what would pull from them their
profeſſion, as that fore-going exhortation [<hi>Let us
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:155276:146"/>
hold faſt our profeſsion]</hi> implyes; Now that which
attempted to pull it from them, were their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
and oppoſitions from without: It appears
alſo becauſe his argument here of comforting
them againſt theſe infirmities, is drawne from
Chriſts example, <hi>In that he was in all things
tempted as we are.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet ſecondly, by [<hi>infirmities</hi>] are meant ſins
alſo, for ſo in the proceſſe of this diſcourſe hee
uſeth the phraſe, and makes them the main ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Highprieſts pity; for in the next words,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 2. ſhewing vvhat the qualifications of the
High-prieſt under the Law were, (who were types
of our great High-prieſt) he makes this one, (ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to this here mentioned) that he was to be one
that <hi>could have compaſsion on the ignorant, and thoſe
that were out of the way;</hi> (that is, upon ſinners, for
ſins are thoſe ignorances and goings aſtray from
God;) and then adds, <hi>in that himſelfe was cloathed
with infirmities;</hi> that is, with ſins. And although
it is ſaid here that Chriſt was without ſin in all,
yet he was tempted by Satan unto all ſorts of ſins,
even as we are. And that by [<hi>infirmities</hi>] ſins are
mainly here intended, is yet more evident from
the remedy propounded againſt them which they
are here encouraged to ſeeke for at the throne of
grace, namely, <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercie. Therefore let us
come boldly to the throne of Grace, that we may finde
[Grace and mercie] to helpe in time of need:</hi> So it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
in the next words. <hi>Grace</hi> to help againſt the
power of ſinne, and <hi>Mercie</hi> againſt the guilt and
puniſhment of it; both which are the greateſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:155276:146"/>
diſcouragers to come boldly to that throne, and
therefore he muſt needs intend thoſe kindes of
<hi>infirmities</hi> chiefly in this his encouragement and
comfortory given.</p>
                     <p>Now ſecondly, for a <hi>ſupport</hi> againſt both theſe,
he lets us underſtand how feelingly and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
affected the heart of Chriſt is to ſinners
under all theſe their <hi>infirmities,</hi> now he is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
(for of him advanced into heaven, he here
ſpeakes, as appeareth by <hi>ver.</hi> 14.) And if the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
with that verſe be obſerved, we ſhall
ſee that he brings in this narration of it ſetly, by
way of preventing an objection which might
otherwiſe ariſe in all mens thoughts from that
high and glorious Deſcription which he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of him in that 14. <hi>ver. [We have a great High-Prieſt,
who is paſſed into the Heavens, &amp;c.]</hi> He knew
wee would be apt from this preſently to thinke,
he may be too great to be an High-Prieſt for
us to tranſact our affaires; and that this great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his might cauſe him to forget us, or if
he did remember us, and take notice of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
yet <hi>being paſſed into the Heavens,</hi> and ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
caſt off the frailties of his fleſh which hee
had here, and having cloathed his humane
nature with ſo great a glory, that therefore hee
cannot now pitie us, as he did when he dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us here below; nor be ſo feelingly affected
and <hi>touched</hi> with our miſeries, as to be tenderly
moved to compaſſionate and commiſerate us, ſo
he is not now capable of a feeling of griefe,
and ſo, not of a <hi>fellow-feeling,</hi> or <hi>ſympathizing</hi>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:155276:147"/>
vvith us; his ſtate and condition now is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all ſuch affections; which affections not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
are they that ſhould put him upon
helping us, heartily and cordially. And for him
to bee expoſed to ſuch affections as theſe,
were a weakeneſſe, an <hi>infirmity</hi> in himſelfe,
which heaven hath cured him of. His power and
glory is ſo great that he cannot bee thus touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
even as the Angels are not: And he is <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
for above all Principalities and powers, Epheſ.</hi>
1. 15.</p>
                     <p>This the Apoſtle carefully pre-occupates; and
it is the very objection which he takes away. <hi>Wee
have not an High-Prieſt who cannot, &amp;c. Duplex
negatio aequipollet affirmationi;</hi> nay, two negatives
doe not onely make an affirmative, but affirme
more ſtrongly: they make an affirmation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to a contrary and oppoſite thought.
Now this ſpeech of his is as much as if he ſhould
have ſaid, Well, let heaven have made what al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
ſoever, upon his condition, in glorifying
his humane nature, which be it never ſo free from
fleſhly paſſions, and in ſtead of fleſh be made
like Heaven; let him be never ſo incapable of
impreſſions from below: yet he retaines one ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
part and bare place in his heart ſtill unarmed,
(as it were) even to ſuffer with you, and to be
touched if you be. The word is a deepe one,
[<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] <hi>He ſuffers with you,</hi> hee is as tender
in his bowels to you as ever he was: that hee
might be moved to pitie you, he is willing to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
(as it were) one place to be left naked, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:155276:147"/>
to be fleſh ſtill, on which he may be vvounded
vvith your miſeries, that ſo he might be your
<hi>mercifull High-prieſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas it may bee objected, that this
were a weakeneſſe: The Apoſtle affirmes that
this is his power, and a perfection and ſtrength
(of love ſurely) in him, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
importeth: that is, that makes him thus <hi>able</hi>
and <hi>powerfull</hi> to take our miſeries into his heart,
though glorified, and ſo to be affected with
them, as if he ſuffered with us, and ſo to relieve
us out of that principle, out of which he would
relieve himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>There are two things which this Text gives
mee occaſion to take notice of, and apart to
handle.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, (more generally) That Chriſts heart
now in heaven, is as graciouſly affected unto
ſinners, as ever it was on earth.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, (more particularly) the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how.</hi> Or thus:</p>
                     <p>1. That he is <hi>touched with a feeling,</hi> or <hi>ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth
with us,</hi> (as the word is.)</p>
                     <p>2. The way how this comes to paſſe; even
through <hi>his having been tempted in all things like
unto us.</hi> In handling the firſt, I ſhall give thoſe
<hi>Intrinſecall</hi> Demonſtrations of it that remaine;
and in handling the other, further open the Text.
To come therefore firſt to thoſe <hi>Intrinſecall</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of this Doctrine, which I engraft
upon theſe words, and ſhoots naturally from
them, namely, That the heart of Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:155276:148"/>
now he is in heaven, is as graciouſly inclined to
ſinners, as ever it was on earth.</p>
                     <div n="1" type="section">
                        <head>§. 1.</head>
                        <head type="sub">The firſt ſort of Intrinſecall Demonſtrations drawn
from the influence all the three Perſons have for ever
into the heart of the Humane nature of Chriſt in
heaven.</head>
                        <p>THe firſt ſort of Demonſtrations ſhall be
fetcht from all the three Perſons, and their
ſeverall influence they have into Chriſts heart in
heaven, to encline it towards us.</p>
                        <p>The firſt ſhall be taken from God his Father,
who hath thus advanced him; and it hath two
parts: 1. That God hath given a perpetuall
command to Chriſt to love ſinners; 2. That
therefore his heart continues the ſame for ever.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt, God the Father <hi>hath given Ieſus
Chriſt a ſpeciall command to love ſinners;</hi> and hath
withall <hi>implanted</hi> a mercifull <hi>gracious diſpoſition in
his heart towards them.</hi> This I mention to argue it,
becauſe it is that which Chriſt alledgeth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.
37. as the originall ground of this diſpoſition of
his, <hi>not to caſt out thoſe that come to him: For it is my
Fathers will</hi> (ſayes he in the following verſes) <hi>that
I ſhould performe that which I came downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for, ver.</hi> 38. And this lyes now ſtill upon
him now he is in heaven, as much as ever: for
<hi>his will alſo is</hi> (ſayes he, <hi>ver.</hi> 39, 40.) <hi>that I ſhould
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:155276:148"/>
raiſe them up at the laſt day,</hi> ſo as it muſt needs
continue the ſame till then. And compare with
this the 10. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> from <hi>ver.</hi> 15. to 18. where
having diſcourſed before of his care and love
to his ſheep, to <hi>give his life</hi> for them, to <hi>know</hi>
and owne them, and <hi>to bring them into the fold, &amp;c.</hi>
he concludes at <hi>ver.</hi> 18. [<hi>This commandment have I
received from my Father.</hi>] It is his <hi>will,</hi> ſayes the 6.
of <hi>Iohn,</hi> (and if a good ſon knowes that a thing is
his fathers mind and will, it is enough to move
him to doe it; much more if it be his expreſſe
command.) And in this 10. of <hi>Iohn</hi> he further
ſayes, that it is the <hi>command</hi> which he had <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Father.</hi> A command is a mans will
peremptorily expreſſed; ſo as there muſt be a
breach, if it be not fulfilled: and ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
hath God given Chriſt concerning us. Out
of both which places I obſerve three things to
be the matter of this will and command of Gods:
Firſt, that Chriſt ſhould die for his ſheep; in
reſpect to which command, he continued ſo to
love them whilſt here, as to <hi>lay downe his life for
them:</hi> ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 15. but then he tooke it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and is aſcended into heaven. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thoſe other two things commanded him,
doe concerne him when he is in glory; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to <hi>receive all that come to him,</hi> which is the
ſecond; and the third, to looke that he <hi>loſe
none of thoſe for whom he dyed,</hi> but to <hi>raiſe them
up.</hi> And for theſe his Fathers command lyes
as ſtrictly on him, now he is in Heaven, as for
dying for them whilſt he was on earth: [<hi>This
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:155276:149"/>
command have I received from my Father, and this
is his will.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>And together with this command, God did
put into his heart (as where he commands he ever
uſeth to doe) ſuch an inſtinct of tranſcendent love
towards them, as ſhall ſo ſtrongly encline him to
performe it, that he ſhall neede no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
He hath put ſuch a <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, ſuch an eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
love into him, as he hath put into the hearts of
parents towards their own children, more then
to all other mens children which they ſee beſides,
although more beautifull and more witty then
their own. And both this commandement, and
this inclination of love towards them, wee have
at once expreſſed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 8. where giving the
reaſon why he became our Mediator, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
himſelfe, he not onely ſayes, <hi>I come to doe
thy will O God;</hi> but alſo, <hi>Thy law is in my bowels:</hi>
In which ſpeech, both theſe two are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</p>
                        <p>1. That command I mentioned is there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
for it is called <hi>a Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And 2. it was a law wrought into ſuitable <hi>diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions</hi>
in his heart; and therefore ſaid to bee a
<hi>Law in his heart or bowels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You may eaſily conceive what Law it was
by the ſubject of it, his <hi>Bowels;</hi> which are ſtill put
for the moſt tender <hi>affections; (Coloſ. 3. 12. Bowels
of mercie, kindneſſe, &amp;c.</hi>) It was no other then that
law of love, mercy and pity to poore ſinners,
which God gave him in charge, as he was to be
Mediator. It was that ſpeciall law which lay on
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:155276:149"/>
him as he was the <hi>ſecond Adam;</hi> like that which
was given to the firſt <hi>Adam, Non concedendi,</hi> over
and above the Morall Law, <hi>not to eate the forbidden
fruit;</hi> ſuch a Law was this he there ſpeakes of: It
was the law of his being a Mediator and a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
(for of that he expreſly ſpeakes, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7.) over
and beſides the Morall Law, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to him with us. The word in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
is, [<hi>In the middeſt] of my bowels,</hi> to ſhew
it was deeply engraven: it had its ſeat in the
center, it ſate neereſt, and was moſt inward in
his heart.</p>
                        <p>Yea, and as that ſpeciall Law of not eating the
forbidden fruit, was to <hi>Adam, Praeceptum Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum,</hi>
(as Divines call it) given over and beſides
all the ten Commandments, to be a <hi>tryall,</hi> a <hi>ſigne</hi>
or <hi>ſymbole</hi> of his obedience to all the reſt; ſuch
was this Law given unto Chriſt, the ſecond
<hi>Adam;</hi> ſo as that God would judge of all his
other obedience unto himſelfe by this: Yea it
was laid on him vvith that earneſtneſſe by God,
and ſo commended by him, as that if ever Chriſt
vvould have him to love him, he ſhould be ſure
to love us. Thus in that place fore-cited, <hi>Iohn</hi>
10. 17, 18. Chriſt comforts himſelfe with this
in his obedience, [<hi>Therefore doth my Father love
me:</hi>] It is ſpoken in relation unto his fulfilling
<hi>this</hi> his <hi>command</hi> formerly mentioned; and ſo
withall imports, as if God ſhould love Chriſt
the better for the love he ſhould ſhew to us; it
pleaſed him ſo well to ſee Chriſt love us. And
ſo it is as if God when he gave Chriſt that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:155276:150"/>
                           <hi>ver.</hi> 18. had ſaid, <hi>Sonne,</hi> as you
vvould have my love continue tovvards you, let
me ſee your love towards me ſhewne in being
kinde to theſe I have given you, <hi>whom I have
loved with the ſame love wherewith I have loved
you;</hi> (as you have it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 23.) As God
vvould have us ſhevv love unto him, by loving
his children: ſo he vvould have Chriſt alſo ſhevv
his love towards him by loving of us.</p>
                        <p>Novv for the ſecond Branch of this Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
namely, that <hi>that</hi> love vvhich Chriſt,
vvhen on earth, expreſſed to be in his heart, and
vvhich made him die for ſinners upon this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of his Father, that it doth certainly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in his heart ſtill, novv that hee is in Heaven,
and that as quick and as tender as ever it was
on earth, even as vvhen he vvas on the Croſſe,
&amp; that becauſe of his Fathers command. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced
thus: For it being a Law vvritten in the
midſt of his bowels by his Father, it becomes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
to him, and ſo indelible, and (as other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Laws of God written in the heart are) perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.
And as in us, when we ſhall be in heaven,
though <hi>Faith</hi> ſhall faile, and <hi>Hope</hi> vaniſh, yet <hi>Love
ſhall continue,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) ſo doth this
love in Chriſts heart continue alſo, and ſuffers no
decay; and is ſhewne as much now in receiving
ſinners, and interceding for them, and being pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
unto them, as then in dying for them. And
this love to ſinners being ſo commanded &amp; preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon him, (as was ſaid) that as he would
have his Father love him, he ſhould love them;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:155276:150"/>
and ſo, being urged upon all that great love that
is betweene him and his Father; this as it muſt
needs worke and boile up a ſtrong love in him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſinners, ſo likewiſe the moſt conſtant and
never-decaying love that could be: And this is
argued from the analogie of that principle upon
which Chriſt urgeth us to love himſelf, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.
10. He moveth his Diſciples to <hi>keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
he gave them, and uſeth this argument,
[<hi>For ſo ſhall you abide in my love;</hi>] and backs it
with his owne inſtance, [<hi>even as I have kept my
Fathers commandments, and abide in his love.</hi>] Now
therefore this being the great Commandment
that God layeth on him, to love, and die for, and
to continue to love, and receive ſinners that
come to him, and raiſe them up at the latter day,
certainly hee continues to keep it moſt exactly, as
being one of the great tyes betweene him and his
Father, ſo to continue in his love to him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo long as hee continues in his Fathers love,
(and now he is in heaven, and at his right hand,
he muſt needs continue in higheſt favour with
him;) ſo long wee may be ſure he continues to
obſerve this. And thus that he ſhould continue
ſtill to love us, both love to his Father, and
love to himſelfe obligeth him: we may therefore
be ſure of him that he both doth it, and will
doe it for ever. O what a comfort is it, that
as children are mutuall pledges and tyes of love
betweene man and wife, ſo that wee ſhould
be made ſuch betweene God the Father and
the Sonne! And this demonſtration is taken
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:155276:151"/>
from the influence of the firſt Perſon of the
Trinity; namely, from God the Father.</p>
                        <p>Then (ſecondly) this his love is not a forced
love, which he ſtrives onely to beare towards us,
becauſe his Father hath commanded him to
marry us; but it is his nature, his diſpoſition:
Which added to the former, affords a ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of the point in hand, and is drawn
from God the Sonne. This diſpoſition is free
and naturall to him; he ſhould not be Gods Son
elſe, nor take after his heavenly Father: unto
whom it is naturall to ſhew mercie, but not ſo to
puniſh, which is his ſtrange worke, but <hi>mercie
pleaſeth him,</hi> he <hi>is the Father of mercie,</hi> hee begets
them naturally. Now Chriſt is his own Sonne,
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> (as by way of diſtinction hee is called)
and his naturall Sonne; yea, his humane nature
being united to the ſecond Perſon, is thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the naturall Son of God, not adopted, as we
are. And if he be his naturall Son in priviledges,
then alſo his Fathers properties are naturall to
him; more naturall then to us, who are but his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted
ſons. And if we <hi>as the elect of God</hi> (who
are but the adopted ſons) are exhorted to put
on <hi>Bowels of mercie, kindneſſe, humbleneſſe of minde,
meekeneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> (as <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12.) then much more muſt
theſe diſpoſitions needs be found in Chriſt the
Naturall Son, and theſe, not <hi>put on by him,</hi> but be
as naturall to him as his Son-ſhip is: <hi>God is love,</hi>
(as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayes) and Chriſt is love covered over
with ſleſh, yea, our fleſh. And beſides, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that as God hath faſhioned the hearts of all
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:155276:151"/>
men, and ſome of the ſonnes of men unto more
mercie and pitie (naturally) then others, and then
the holy Spirit comming on them to ſanctifie
their natural diſpoſitions, uſeth to work according
to their tempers; even ſo it is certain, that he tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
the heart of Chriſt, and made it of a ſofter
mold and temper then the tendernes of all mens
hearts put together into one (to ſoften it) would
have been of. When he was to aſſume an humane
nature, he is brought in, ſaying, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.) <hi>A body
haſt thou fitted me:</hi> That is, an humane nature,
fitted as in other things, ſo in the temper of it, for
the God-head to work and ſhew his perfections
in beſt. And as he tooke an humane nature on
purpoſe to be a mercifull High Prieſt; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.
14. ſo ſuch an humane nature, and of ſo ſpeciall a
temper and frame as might be more mercifull
then all Men or Angles. His humane nature was
<hi>made without hands;</hi> that is, was not of the ordinary
make that other mens hearts are of: though for
the matter the ſame, yet not for the frame of his
ſpirit. It was an heart beſpoke for on purpoſe to
be made a <hi>veſſel,</hi> or rather <hi>fountain</hi> of <hi>mercie,</hi> wide
and capable enough to be ſo extended, as to take
in and give forth to us again, all Gods <hi>Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
mercies,</hi> that is, all the mercies God intended
to manifeſt to his elect: &amp; therefore Chriſts heart
had naturally in the temper of it, more pity then
all men or Angles have, as through which the
mercies of the great God were to be diſpenſed
<hi>unto us;</hi> and this heart of his to be the inſtrument
of them. And then, this man and the heart of this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:155276:152"/>
man ſo framed, being united to God, and being
made the naturall Son of God, now natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
muſt mercie needs be unto him?</p>
                        <p>And therefore continue in him now hee is in
Heaven: For though he laid down all infirmities
of our nature, when he roſe again; yet no graces
that were in him whilſt he was below: they are
in him now as much as ever, and being his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
(for <hi>nature</hi> we know is conſtant,) therefore
ſtill remains. You may obſerve, that when he
was upon earth, minding to perſwade ſinners to
have good thoughts of him, as he uſed that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of his Fathers command given him; ſo
hee alſo layes open his own diſpoſition: <hi>Mat.</hi>
11. 28. <hi>Come to me you that are weary and heavy
laden,—for I am meek and lowly of heart.</hi> Men
are apt to have contrary conceits of Chriſt, but
he tells them his diſpoſition there, by preventing
ſuch hard thoughts of him, to allure them unto
him the more. We are apt to thinke, that hee
being ſo holy, is therefore of a ſevere and
ſowre diſpoſition againſt ſinners, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to beare them; no, ſayes he, <hi>I am meek,</hi>
gentleneſſe is my nature and temper; as it was
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was (as in other things, ſo)
in that grace his Type: he was not revenged
on <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> but interceded for them.
So ſayes Chriſt; injuries and unkindneſſes doe
not ſo worke upon me, as to make mee irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable,
it is my nature to forgive; <hi>I am meeke.</hi>
Yea, but (may we thinke) he being the Sonne
of God, and Heire of Heaven, and eſpecially
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:155276:152"/>
being now filled with glory, and ſitting at Gods
right hand, he may now deſpiſe the lowlineſſe
of us here below; though not out of anger,
yet out of that heighth of his greatneſſe and
diſtance that he is advanced unto, in that we
are too meane for him to marry, or bee fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
with: Hee ſurely hath higher thoughts,
then to regard ſuch poore low things as we are:
And ſo though indeed we conceive him meeke,
and not prejudiced with injuries, yet he may bee
too high and lofty to condeſcend ſo far as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,
or take to heart the condition of poore
creatures. No, ſayes Chriſt, <hi>I am lowly</hi> alſo, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to beſtow my love and favour upon the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
and meaneſt. And further, all this is not a
ſemblance of ſuch an affable diſpoſition, nor is it
externally put on in the face and outward carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
onely (as in many great ones, that will
ſeeme gentle and curteous) but there is all this
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>in the heart:</hi> it is his temper, his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
his nature to be gracious: which nature
he can never lay aſide. And that his greatneſſe
when he comes to enjoy it in Heaven would not
a whit alter his diſpoſition in him, appears by this,
that he at the very ſame time when he uttered
theſe words, tooke into conſideration all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to come, and utters both <hi>that</hi> and his meeknes
with the ſame breath: So ver 27. <hi>All things are
delivered to mee by my Father:</hi> and preſently after
for all this he ſayes, <hi>Come unto me all you that are
heavie laden,—[I am meeke and lowly;] ver.</hi> 28,
29. Looke therefore what lovely, ſweete, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:155276:153"/>
delightfull thoughts you uſe to have of a deere
friend, who is of an amiable nature, or of ſome
eminently holy or meeke Saint, of whom you
thinke with your ſelves, I could put my ſoule into
ſuch a mans hands, &amp; can comprimiſe my ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to him (as I have heard it ſpoken of ſome:) Or
looke how we ſhould have beene encouraged to
have dealt with <hi>Moſes</hi> in matter of forgiveneſſe,
(who was the meekeſt man on earth) or treated
with <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> by what we reade of his bowels
towards his brethren: or what thoughts we have
of the tender hearts of <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Timothy</hi> unto the
ſoules of men in begetting, and in nurturing and
bringing them up to life <hi>(being affectionately deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of you, we were willing</hi> (ſayes <hi>Paul) to impart our
own ſoules to you, 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 8.) and this, <hi>naturally,</hi>
(as his word is, 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> 20.) even ſuch and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more raiſed apprehenſions ſhould wee
have of that ſweeteneſſe and candour that is
in Jeſus Chriſt, as being much more naturall to
him.</p>
                        <p>And therefore the ſame Apoſtle doth make
Chriſts bowels the patterne of his, <hi>Phil. 1. 8. Ge<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

is my witneſſe, how greatly I long after you in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels
of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> This phraſe <hi>[in the bowels of
Chriſt]</hi> hath (according to Interpreters) two
meanings, and both ſerve to illuſtrate that which
I intend: Firſt, <hi>[in the bowels of Chriſt]</hi> is taken
<hi>cauſally,</hi> as if he meant to ſhew that thoſe bowels
or compaſſions were infuſed into him from Chriſt,
and ſo longed after them with ſuch kind of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels,
as Chriſt had wrought in him: and if ſo,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:155276:153"/>
that Chriſt put ſuch bowels into him, hath he
not them in himſelfe much more? <hi>Paul</hi> had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to ſay, <hi>[in the bowels of Chriſt]</hi> for (in this
ſenſe) I am ſure he (once) had ſcarce the heart
and bowels of a man in him; namely, when he
was out of Chriſt, how furious and Lion-like a
ſpirit had he againſt the Saints, and what havock
made he of them, being ready even to pull out
their bowels? And how came <hi>Paul</hi> by ſuch ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
bowels now towards them? who gave him
now ſuch tender affections? Even Jeſus Chriſt,
it was he that of a Lion made him a Lambe. If
therefore in <hi>Paul</hi> theſe bowels were not naturall,
(but the contrary rather were naturall to him)
and yet they ſo abounded in him, and that <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,</hi>
as himſelfe ſpeakes; how much more
muſt they needs abound in Chriſt, to whom
they are native and in-bred? Or elſe ſecondly,
<hi>[In] the bowels,</hi> is put for <hi>[Inſtar] Like the bowels,</hi>
or <hi>After the bowels,</hi> according to the analogie of
the Hebrew phraſe: And ſo then the meaning
were this, Like as the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt do
yerne after you, ſo doe mine. <hi>[Bowels]</hi> are a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor
to ſignifie tender and motherly affections
and mercies: ſo <hi>Luke 1. 78. [Through the tender
mercies;]</hi> In the originall it is <hi>[The bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.]</hi>
Thus <hi>Paul</hi> when he would ſignifie how tender
his affections were, he inſtances in the Bowels
of Jeſus Chriſt, (he making Chriſt his pattern in
this in all, <hi>[Be ye followers of me, as I am of Chriſt.])</hi>
Now how deſirous was this great Apoſtle to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
men to Chriſt? he cared not what elſe hee
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:155276:154"/>
loſt, ſo he might <hi>winne ſome:</hi> he <hi>counted not his
life deare,</hi> nay not his ſalvation deare, but <hi>wiſht
himſelfe accurſed for his brethren,</hi> (who yet vvere
the greateſt enemies Chriſt then had on earth:)
How glad was he when any ſoule came in? how
ſorry when any fell off? <hi>falling into a new travail</hi>
(he knew not how better to expreſſe the anxietie
of his ſpirit) for the <hi>Galatians,</hi> till <hi>Chriſt was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in them:</hi> Hovv comforted vvas he vvhen he
heard tidings of the conſtancie and encreaſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their Faith? 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 6, 7. and <hi>ver.</hi> 8.
he ſayes, <hi>for now we live, if you ſtand faſt in the Lord.</hi>
Reade all his Epiſtles, and take the character of
his ſpirit this vvay; and vvhen you have done,
look up to Chriſts humane nature in Heaven, and
thinke vvith your ſelves, <hi>Such a man is Chriſt. Paul</hi>
vvarbles out in all theſe high ſtrains of affections
but the <hi>ſoundings of Chriſts Bowels</hi> in Heaven in a
lower key:<note place="margin">Eſay. 63.</note> They are naturall to Chriſt, they all
and infinite more are eminent in him. And this
is the ſecond Demonſtration taken from his own
naturall diſpoſition as Sonne of God.</p>
                        <p>A third demonſtration ſhall bee taken from
the Third Perſon of the Trinity, the holy Ghoſt.
If the ſame ſpirit that was upon him, and in him,
when he was on earth, doth but ſtill reſt upon him
now he is in Heaven, then theſe diſpoſitions muſt
needes ſtill entirely remaine in him.</p>
                        <p>This Demonſtration is made up of two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
put together: 1. That the holy Ghoſt
dwelling in him, concurs to make his heart thus
graciouſly affected to ſinners: And 2. that the ſame
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:155276:154"/>
ſpirit dwels and continues in and upon him for
ever in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt, It was the Spirit who over-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
his mother, and in the meane while knit
that indiſſoluble knot betweene our nature and
the ſecond Perſon, and that alſo knit his heart
unto us; It was the Spirit who ſanctified him in
the vvombe; It vvas the Spirit that reſted on him
above meaſure, and fitted him vvith a meek ſpirit
for the vvorks of his mediation; and indeed for
this very grace ſake of meekneſſe did the Spirit
come more eſpecially upon him. Therefore when
he was firſt ſolemnly inaugurated into that office,
at his Baptiſme, (for then he viſibly and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
entred upon the execution of it) the <hi>holy
Ghoſt deſcended</hi> upon him: and how? <hi>as a Dove;</hi> ſo all
the Euangeliſts joyntly report it. But why in the
ſhape of a Dove? All apparitions that God at any
time made of himſelf, were not ſo much to ſhew
what God is in himſelfe, as how he is affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, and declare what effects he works in us:
ſo here, this ſhape of a Dove reſting upon him,
vvas to ſhew thoſe ſpeciall gracious diſpoſitions
wherewith the holy Ghoſt fitted Jeſus Chriſt to
be a Mediator. A <hi>Dove</hi> (you know) is the moſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>
and moſt meek creature, <hi>without gall, without
tallons,</hi> having no fierceneſſe in it, expreſſing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but love and friendſhip to its mate in all its
carriages, and mourning over it in its diſtreſſes:
and was therefore a fit embleme to expreſſe
what a frame and temper of ſpirit the holy Ghoſt
did upon this his deſcending on him, fill the heart
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:155276:155"/>
of Chriſt with, and this without meaſure: that as
ſweetly as doves doe converſe with doves, ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiſing
and mourning each over other, ſo may
we with Chriſt, for he thus ſympathizeth with us.
And though he had the Spirit before, yet now he
was anointed with him (in reſpect of ſuch effects
as theſe, which appertained to the execution of his
office) with a larger meaſure, and more eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then before. Therefore the Euangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi>
notes upon it, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 1.) Ieſus being full of the
holy Ghoſt, returned from <hi>Iordan.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> alſo
puts the like gloſſe upon it, as appeares <hi>Act.</hi> 10.
37. for ſpeaking there of the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
he ſhews how <hi>after that his being baptized, he began
to preach;</hi> and <hi>how God having anointed him with the
holy Ghoſt,</hi> (namely, at that baptiſme of his) <hi>hee
went about doing good, &amp;c.</hi> And that this was the
principall thing ſignified by this deſcending of
the holy Ghoſt as a Dove upon him, (even chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to note out his meekeneſſe, and ſympathizing
heart with ſinners, vvrought in him by the holy
Ghoſt) is evident by two places, vvhere Chriſt
himſelfe puts that very intendment on it.</p>
                        <p>The firſt preſently after, in the firſt Sermon that
he preached after that his having received the
holy Ghoſt, (in the ſame 4. of <hi>Luke</hi>) where firſt it
is noted <hi>ver.</hi> 1. that he returned from being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<hi>full of the Spirit,</hi> and ſo was led to be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
then <hi>ver.</hi> 14. it is ſaid that hee returned
from being tempted <hi>in the power of that ſpirit,</hi> and
after this is explained by himſelfe the myſtery
of his having received the Spirit in the likeneſſe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:155276:155"/>
of a dove, and this is the ſubject matter of the
firſt Text which he opened in his firſt Sermon,
ſingled out by him on purpoſe, by choice, not
chance, out of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which he read to them, (<hi>ver.</hi>
18.) <hi>[The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he
hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poore,</hi>
(that is, in ſpirit, the afflicted in conſcience for
ſinne) <hi>he hath ſent me to heale the broken-hearted, to
preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering
ſight to the blind, to ſet at liberty them that are
bruiſed, &amp;c.]</hi> And when he had read ſo much
as concerned the expreſſing the compaſſionate
diſpoſition of his ſpirit unto ſinners, (whoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
he ſets downe by all ſorts of outward evils)
then he reads no further, but cloſeth the Book,
as intimating, that theſe were the maine effects
of that his receiving the Spirit. <hi>[The Spirit of the
Lord is upon me, [becauſe] he hath anointed me to
preach the Goſpel to the poore:]</hi> That is, for this
end, or for this very purpoſe hath he given me
his Spirit, <hi>becauſe</hi> I was deſigned, or <hi>anointed</hi> to
this work, and by that Spirit alſo hath he anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or qualified me with theſe gifts and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſuitable to that worke.</p>
                        <p>Another place that makes the fruit and end
of his receiving the Spirit then at his baptiſme,
to be theſe tender diſpoſitions unto ſinners, is
that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 18, 19, &amp;c. out of another place
of <hi>Iſaith, [Behold my beloved, in whom my ſoule is well
pleaſed, I will put my Spirit upon him, and he ſhall ſhew
judgement to the Gentiles, &amp;c.]</hi> That ſeems to be a
terrible word, but be not afraid of it; for by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:155276:156"/>
                           <hi>[judgement]</hi> is meant even the doctrine of free
grace and of the Goſpell, that changeth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
men: As in like manner (according to the
Hebrew phraſe) in <hi>ver.</hi> 20. by <hi>judgement</hi> is meant
the worke of Gods grace on mens hearts: When
he ſayes <hi>[He will ſend forth judgement unto victory,]</hi>
the worke of grace being the counterpane of the
Doctrine of grace. And in preaching this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
(which in it ſelfe is good tidings) the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
ſhews hovv he ſhould carrie it vvith a ſpirit,
anſwerable and ſuitable thereunto, even full of all
meekneſſe, ſtilneſſe, calmneſſe, and modeſty,
which he expreſſeth by proverbiall ſpeeches uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in thoſe times, to expreſſe ſo much by, <hi>[He ſhall
not ſtrive, nor crie, neither ſhall any man heare his voice
in the ſtreets:]</hi> that is, he ſhall deal with all ſtilneſſe
and meekneſſe; without violence, or boiſterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<hi>Iohn</hi> had the <hi>voice of a cryer,</hi> he was a man of
a ſevere ſpirit; but Chriſt came <hi>piping and dancing;</hi>
all melodious ſweetneſſe was in his miniſtery and
ſpirit; and in the courſe of his miniſtery he went
ſo tenderly to work, he was ſo heedfull to bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſoules, and had ſuch regard to their diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,
that it is ſaid <hi>he would not break a brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
reed:</hi> That is, he would ſet his ſteps with ſuch
heed, as not to tread on a reed that was broken
in the leafe; or he would walk ſo lightly and
ſoftly, that if it lay in his way, though he went
over it, yet he would not have further <hi>bruiſed</hi>
it; nor quenched either by treading out <hi>the ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
flax,</hi> (which is eaſily done) or vvith any
ruſhing motion have raiſed ſo much vvind as to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:155276:156"/>
blow out a weike of a candle, (as ſome tranſlate
it) ſmoaking in the ſocket; which the leaſt ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the aire puffes out. All this is to expreſſe
the tenderneſſe of his heart; and this, upon his
receiving the Spirit, and eſpecially from the
time of his baptizing: for then (you know) thoſe
words were together therewith uttered, <hi>[This
is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed]</hi> and they
are the ſame words alſo, which together with
Gods giving him the Spirit, are joyned in that 40.
of <hi>Eſay,</hi> whence theſe words are taken. So that he
was filled with the Spirit, to that end to raiſe up
in him ſuch ſweet affections towards ſinners.</p>
                        <p>Now for the ſecond part that goes to make
up this Demonſtration: It is as certaine, that the
ſame Spirit that was upon Chriſt, and acted his
ſpirit here below, doth ſtill abide upon him in
heaven. It muſt never be ſaid, The Spirit of the
Lord is departed from <hi>Him,</hi> who is the Sender and
Beſtower of the holy Ghoſt upon us. And if the
Spirit once comming upon his Members <hi>abides
with them for ever,</hi> (as Chriſt promiſeth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.
16.) then much more doth this Spirit abide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Chriſt the Head, from whom we all (ſince
Chriſt was in heaven) receive that Spirit, and
by vertue of which Spirits dwelling in him, he
continues to dwell in us. Therefore of him it is
ſaid, (<hi>Eſay</hi> 11. 2.) <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall [reſt]
upon him.</hi> Yea, and in that ſtorie of the holy
Ghoſts deſending upon him at his Baptiſme, it
is not onely recorded, that <hi>He deſcended on him,</hi>
but over and above it is added, <hi>[And abode upon
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:155276:157"/>
him.</hi>] Yea further, to put the greater emphaſis up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, it is twice repeated: So <hi>Iohn 1. 32. I ſaw the
Spirit</hi> (ſayes the Euangeliſt) <hi>deſcending from heaven
like a Dove,</hi> (and hee adds this alſo as a further
thing obſerved by him) [<hi>and it abode upon him.</hi>]
And then againe, <hi>ver. 33. I knew him not,</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>but he that ſent me,</hi> gave me this token to know
him by, <hi>Vpon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
[and remaining on him,] the ſame is he.</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(as it is intimated there) he <hi>reſted on him,</hi>
to that end, that he might baptize us with the
holy Ghoſt unto the end of the world: [<hi>The ſame</hi>
(ſayes he) <hi>is he that baptizeth with the holy Ghoſt.</hi>]
He at firſt <hi>deſcends</hi> as a Dove, and then <hi>abides</hi> as a
Dove for ever upon him; and this Dove it ſelfe
came from heaven firſt: And therefore certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
now that Chriſt himſelfe is gone to heaven,
he abides and ſits upon him much more as a Dove
ſtill there. Moreover, let me adde this, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Spirit reſted on him here without
meaſure in compariſon of us; yet it may be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid, that the Spirit in reſpect of his effects in
gifts of grace and glory, reſts more abundantly
on him in heaven, then he did on earth, even in
the ſame ſenſe that at his baptiſme (as was ſaid)
he reſted on him in ſuch reſpects more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then he did before his Baptiſme, during the
time of his private life: For as when he came to
heaven he was enſtalled King and Prieſt as it were
anew, in reſpect of a new execution: ſo for the
work to be done in heaven, he was anew anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this <hi>oyle of gladneſſe above his fellowes,</hi>
                           <pb n="67" facs="tcp:155276:157"/>
(as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7.) Which place is meant of him
eſpecially as he is in heaven, at Gods <hi>right hand,
in fulneſſe of joy,</hi> (as <hi>Pſal. 16. ult.</hi> it is alſo ſpoken of
him:) when alſo it is, that <hi>he goes forth</hi> in his <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to conquer,</hi> (as <hi>ver.</hi> 4. of that 45. <hi>Pſal.</hi>) And
yet then, <hi>Meekneſſe</hi> is not far off, but is made
one of his diſpoſitions in this heighth of glory:
So it followes in the fore-cited verſe, <hi>In thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ride proſperouſly, becauſe of Truth and Meekneſſe,
&amp;c.</hi> Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes, (<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 36.) that
<hi>That ſame Ieſus whom you</hi> (Jews) <hi>have crucified,</hi>
(and who was riſen, and aſcended) <hi>God hath made
both Lord and Chriſt: [Lord,</hi>] that is, hath exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him as King in heaven; and [<hi>Chriſt,</hi>] that is,
hath alſo <hi>anointed him:</hi> (and this Oyle is no other
then the holy Ghoſt) with whom (the ſame <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
tells us) he was anointed at his Baptiſme, <hi>Acts</hi>
10. 38. Yea, and becauſe he then at once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Spirit in the fulleſt meaſure that for ever
he was to receive him; therefore it was that he
ſhed him downe on his Apoſtles, and <hi>baptized
them with him,</hi> (as in that 2. of the <hi>Acts</hi> we reade.)
Now it is a certaine rule, that <hi>whatſoever</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from Chriſt, <hi>that</hi> he himſelfe firſt receives
in himſelfe for us. And ſo one reaſon why this
oile ran then ſo plentifully downe on the skirts
of this our High-prieſt, that is, on his members
the Apoſtles and Saints, (and ſo continues to do
unto this day) is becauſe our High-prieſt and Head
himſelfe was then afreſh anointed with it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>ver.</hi> 33. of that 2. of the <hi>Acts, Peter</hi> giving an
account how it came to paſſe that they were ſo
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:155276:158"/>
filled with the holy Ghoſt, ſayes, that Chriſt <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received from the Father the promiſe of the holy
Ghoſt, had ſhed him forth on them;</hi> which <hi>receiving</hi>
is not to be only underſtood of his bare and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
receiving the promiſe of the holy Ghoſt for
us, by having power then given him to ſhed him
downe upon them, as God had promiſed, (though
this is a true meaning of it) but further that hee
had received him firſt as powred forth on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſo ſhed him forth on them: according to
that rule, that whatever God doth unto us by
Chriſt, he firſt doth it unto Chriſt: all promiſes
are made and fulfilled unto him firſt, and ſo unto
us in him; all that he beſtows on us, he receives
in himſelfe. And this may bee one reaſon why
(as <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 39.) the <hi>Spirit was not as yet given, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Ieſus was not as yet glorified:</hi> But now he is in
heaven, he is ſaid <hi>to have the ſeven ſpirits:</hi> ſo <hi>Rev.</hi>
1. 3. (which book ſets him out as he is ſince he
went to heaven.) Now <hi>thoſe ſeven ſpirits</hi> are the
holy Ghoſt, for ſo it muſt needs be meant, and
not of any creature, as appeares by the 4. <hi>ver.</hi> of
that <hi>Chap.</hi> where <hi>grace and peace</hi> are wiſht <hi>from the
ſeven ſpirits:</hi> ſo called, in reſpect of the various ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of him both in Chriſt and us, though but one
in perſon. And ſeven is a number of perfection, &amp;
is therefore there mentioned, to ſhew, that now
Chriſt hath the Spirit in the utmoſt meaſure that
the humane nature is capable of. And as his
knowledge (which is a fruit of the Spirit) ſince
his Aſcenſion is enlarged, (for before he knew
not when the day of Judgement ſhould be, but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:155276:158"/>
now when he wrote this book of the Revelation,
he did) ſo are his bowels (I ſpeak of the humane
nature) extended; all the mercies that God meanes
to beſtow being now actually to run through his
hands, and his particular notice, and he to beſtow
them not on Jewes only, but on Gentiles alſo,
who were to be converted after he went to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And ſo he hath now an heart adequate to
Gods own heart, in the utmoſt extent of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mercie unto any whom God hath intended
it unto.</p>
                        <p>And this is the third demonſtration from the
<hi>Spirits</hi> dwelling in him; wherein you may help
your faith, by an experiment of the holy Ghoſt his
dwelling in your own hearts, and there not only
working in you meekeneſſe towards others, but
pitty towards your ſelves, to get your ſoules ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and to that end, ſtirring up in you inceſſant
and <hi>unutterable groanes</hi> before the Throne of grace,
for grace and mercie. Now the ſame Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in Chriſts heart in heaven, that doth in yours
here, and always working in his heart firſt for
you, and then in yours by commiſſion from him;
reſt aſſured therefore, that that Spirit ſtirs up in
him bowels of mercie infinitely larger towards
you, then you can have unto your ſelves.</p>

of this world, whereto no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,

how as his relations continued, ſo his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
remained the ſame to his poore brethren,

his affections appeared alſo to be the ſame; for

She conſidered but her relation, and how doth it
work in her veyns by a ſympathie of bloud? Now
much more doth this hold good of husband and
wife, for they are in a neerer relation yet. Let the
wife have beene one that was poore and meane,
fallen iuto ſickneſſe, &amp;c. and let the husband be
as great and glorious as <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his royaltie;
all man-kind would cry ſhame on ſuch a man, if
he ſhould not now owne his wife, and be a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in all love and reſpect to her ſtill. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all theſe relations, the relation of Head and
Members, as it is moſt naturall, ſo it obligeth
moſt: <hi>No man ever yet hated his owne fleſh,</hi> (ſayes
the Apoſtle) (though diſeaſed and leprous) <hi>but
loveth and cheriſheth it.</hi> And it is the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that <hi>if one member be honoured, all the members</hi>
are to <hi>rejoyce with it,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 26.) <hi>and if one
member ſuffer, all the reſt</hi> are to <hi>ſuffer with it. Even
ſo</hi> is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (as <hi>ver.</hi> 12.) And theſe relations are
they that doe move Chriſt to continue his love
unto us. <hi>Ieſus knowing that he was to depart out of
this world, having loved his owne who were in the
world, he loved them unto the end, Iohn</hi> 13. 1. And
the reaſon thereof is put upon his relation to
them; they were <hi>his owne;</hi> and his owne by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of all relations whatſoever, his owne Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
his owne Spouſe, his owne fleſh; and <hi>the</hi>
very <hi>world will love its owne,</hi> (as himſelfe ſpeaks)
much more will he himſelfe love his owne. <hi>He
that provides not for his owne family, is worſe then
an Infidel,</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle.) Now though
Chriſt be in heaven, yet his people are his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:155276:161"/>
ſtill: they are retainers to him, though they
be on earth; and this, as truly as thoſe that ſtand
about his perſon now he is in his glory. So that
ſpeech evidently declares, [<hi>Of whom the whole
family in heaven and earth is named</hi>] they all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
make up but one and the ſame family to
him as their Lord. Chriſt is both the <hi>founder,</hi> the
<hi>ſubject,</hi> and the moſt perfect <hi>exemplar</hi> and <hi>patterne</hi>
to us, of all the relations that are found on earth.
Firſt he is the founder of all relations, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that accompanie them both in nature and
grace. As therefore the Pſalmiſt argues, <hi>ſhall he
not ſee who made the eye?</hi> So doe I; Shall not he who
put all theſe affections into parents, and brothers,
ſuitable to their relations, ſhall not he have them
much more in himſelfe? <hi>Though</hi> our Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
being in heaven <hi>be ignorant of us, and Iſrael ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
us not, yet O Lord, thou art our Father, &amp; our
Redeemer, &amp;c, Iſai.</hi> 36. 16. the Prophet ſpeakes it
of Chriſt; as appears by <hi>ver.</hi> 1, and 2. and in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
of the Jews Call; &amp; he ſpeaks it of Chriſt,
as ſuppoſed in Heaven, for he adds, <hi>Looke downe
from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
and thy glory.</hi> There are but two things that
ſhould make him to neglect ſinners; his <hi>holineſſe,</hi> as
they are ſinners, and his <hi>glory,</hi> as they are meane
and low creatures: Now he there mentions both,
to ſhew, that notwithſtanding either as they are
ſinners he rejects them not, and as they are baſe
and mean he deſpiſeth them not.</p>
                        <p>2. He is the <hi>Subject</hi> of <hi>all</hi> relations, which no
creature is. If'a man be a husband, yet not a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:155276:162"/>
father, or a brother; but Chriſt is all: No one
relation being ſufficient to expreſſe his love,
where with he loveth and owneth us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he calls his Church both <hi>Siſter</hi> and <hi>Spouſe,
Cantic.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
                        <p>3. He is the <hi>patterne,</hi> and exemplar of all theſe
our relatious, and they all are but the copies of
his. Thus in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. Chriſt is made the pattern
of the relation and love of husbands; <hi>Husbands</hi>
(ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>love your wives, as Chriſt loved his
Church,</hi> ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 25. Yea, <hi>ver.</hi> 31, 32, 33. the marriage
of <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; the very words he then ſpake, of clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to a wife, are made but the types and ſhadows
of Chriſt marriage to his Church. Herein I
ſpeak (ſayes he) <hi>concerning Chriſt and the Church:</hi>
and <hi>this is a great myſtery.</hi> Firſt, a <hi>myſtery,</hi> that is,
this marriage of <hi>Adam</hi> was ordained <hi>hiddenly,</hi>
to repreſent and ſignifie Chriſts marriage with
his Church. And ſecondly, it is a <hi>great</hi> myſtery,
becauſe the thing thereby ſignified is in it ſelf ſo
great, that this is but a ſhadow of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all thoſe relations, and the affections of
them, and the effects of thoſe affections, which
you ſee and read to have been in men, are all, and
were ordained to be (as all things elſe in this
world are) but ſhadows of what is in Chriſt; who
alone is the truth and ſubſtance of all ſimilitudes
in nature, as well as of the Ceremoniall types.</p>
                        <p>If therefore no advancement doth or ought to
alter ſuch relations in men, then not in Chriſt. <hi>He
is not aſhamed to call us brethren;</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11. And yet
the Apoſtle had juſt before ſaid of him, <hi>v. 9. We ſee
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:155276:162"/>
Ieſus crowned with glory &amp; honour.</hi> Yea &amp; as when one
member ſuffers, the reſt are touched with a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie,
ſo is it with Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> perſecuted the
Saints, the members, and <hi>why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi>
cries the Head in heaven: the foot was trodden
on, but the Head felt it, though <hi>crowned with
glory and honour. We are fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of
his bone, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 30. &amp; therefore as <hi>Eſther</hi> ſaid, ſo
ſayes Chriſt, <hi>How can I endure to ſee the evill that
befalls my people?</hi> If a husband hath a wife that is
meane, and he become a King, it were his glory
and not his ſhame to advance her; yea, it were
his ſhame to neglect her: eſpecially, if when the
betrothment was firſt made, ſhe was then rich
and glorious, and a Kings daughter, but ſince
that, falne into poverty and miſery. Now Chriſts
Spouſe, though now ſhe be falne into ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
yet when ſhe was firſt given to Chriſt by
God the Father, (who from all eternity made the
match) ſhe was lookt upon as all glorious. For in
election, at firſt, both Chriſt and we were by
God conſidered in that glorie which he meanes
to bring him and us unto at laſt; that being <hi>firſt</hi>
in Gods <hi>intention,</hi> which is <hi>laſt</hi> in <hi>execution.</hi> For
God at the beginning doth look at the end of his
works, and at what he meanes to make them.
And ſo, he then primitively intending to make us
thus glorious as we ſhall be, he brought and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
us to his Sonne in that glaſſe of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
under that face of glory wherewith at laſt
he meant to endow us. He ſhewed us to him as
apparelled with all thoſe jewels of grace and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:155276:163"/>
glory which we ſhall weare in heaven; he did this
then, even as he brought <hi>Eve</hi> unto <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe
marriage was in all the type of this: ſo that as this
was the firſt Idea that God tooke us up in, and that
we appeared in before him, ſo alſo wherein he
preſented us then to Chriſt, and (as it were) ſaid,
ſuch a wife will I give thee. And as ſuch did the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Perſon marry us; and undertooke to bring us
to that eſtate. And that God ordained us thus to
fall into ſinne &amp; miſerie, was but to illuſtrate the
ſtory of Chriſts love, &amp; thereby to render this our
Lover and Husband the more glorious in his love
to us, and to make this primitive condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
God meant againe to bring us, the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
illuſtrious. And therefore we being marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him, when we were thus glorious in Gods
firſt intention, although in his decrees about the
execution of this, or the bringing us to this glory,
we fall into meanneſſe and miſerie before we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to it, yet the marriage ſtill holds; Chriſt took
us to run the ſame fortune with us, and that we
ſhould do the like with him. And hence it was, that
we being falne into ſinne, and ſo our <hi>fleſh</hi> become
<hi>fraile</hi> and <hi>ſubject to infirmities,</hi> that he therefore <hi>took
part of the ſame,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 13. And anſwerably on the
other ſide, he being now advanced to the glory or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for him, he can never reſt till he hath reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
us to that beauty wherein at firſt we were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to him, &amp; til he hath purged and <hi>cleanſed us,
that ſo he may preſent us to himſelfe a glorious Church,</hi>
(as you have it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26, 27.) even ſuch as in Gods
firſt intention we were ſhewne to him to become;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:155276:163"/>
having that native and originall beauty, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
that eſtate wherein he looked upon us,
when he firſt tooke liking to us, and married us.
This is argued there from this very relation of
his being our husband, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. 26. And therefore
though Chriſt be now in glorie, yet let not that
diſcourage you, for he hath the heart of a husband
towards you, being <hi>betrothed unto you for ever, in
faithfulneſſe, and in loving kindneſſe,</hi> (as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.) and
the idea of that beauty is ſo imprinted on his
heart, which from everlaſting was ordained you,
that he will never ceaſe to ſanctifie and to cleanſe
you, till he hath reſtored you to that beauty which
once he tooke ſuch a liking of.</p>
                        <p>A ſecond engagement. This love of his unto us is
yet further encreaſed, by what he both did, and
ſuffered for us here on earth, before he went to
heaven. <hi>Having loved his own,</hi> ſo far as to dye for
them, <hi>he will</hi> certainly <hi>love them unto the end,</hi> even
to eternity. We ſhall finde in all ſorts of relations,
both ſpirituall and naturall, that the having done
much for any beloved of us, doth beget a further
care and love towards them. And the like effect
thoſe eminent ſufferings of Chriſt for us, have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
produced in him; we may ſee this in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
for beſides that naturall affection planted
in mothers towards their children, (as they are
theirs) the very pains, hard labour, and travail
they were at in bringing them forth, encreaſeth
their affections towards them, and that in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
degree them fathers beare. And therefore the
eminencie of affection is attributed unto that of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:155276:164"/>
the <hi>mother</hi> towards her child, and put upon this
that it is <hi>the ſonne of her wombe, Iſai.</hi> 49. 15. And
then, the performing of that office and worke of
nurſing them themſelves, (which yet is done
with much trouble and diſquietment) doth (in
experience) yet more endeare thoſe their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
unto them which they ſo nurſe, to an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
difference of bowels and love, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that which they put forth to others of
their owne children which they nurſed not. And
therefore in the ſame place of <hi>Eſay,</hi> as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
affection to <hi>the ſonne of her wombe,</hi> ſo to her
<hi>ſucking child,</hi> is mentioned, as being the higheſt
inſtance of ſuch love. And as thus in paternall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
ſo alſo in conjugall. In ſuch mutuall loves in
the purſuing of which, there have any difficulties
or hardſhips been encountred; and the more
thoſe lovers have ſuffered the one for the other,
the more is the edge of their deſires whetted, and
their love encreaſed; and the party for whom
they ſuffered, is thereby rendred the more deere
unto them.</p>
                        <p>And as it is thus in theſe naturall relations, ſo
alſo in ſpirituall; we may ſee it in holy men, as
in <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was a mediator for the Jewes, as
Chriſt is for us; <hi>Moſes</hi> therein being but Chriſts
Type and ſhadow, and therefore I the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in him. He under God had beene the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
of the people of Iſrael out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with
the hazard of his own life, &amp; had led them in the
wilderneſſe, and given them that good Law that
was their wiſdome in the ſight of all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:155276:164"/>
and by his prayers kept off Gods wrath from
them. And who ever (of all thoſe <hi>Heroes</hi> we read
of) did ſo much for any Nation, who yet were
continually murmuring at him, and had like once
to have ſtoned him? and yet, what he had done
for them did ſo mightily engage his heart, and
ſo immoveably point and fixe it unto their
good, that although God in his wrath againſt
them, offered to make of him alone a greater and
mightier Nation then they were, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that offer (the greateſt that ever any Sonne of
<hi>Adam</hi> was tempted with,) and ſtill went on to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
for them, and among other uſed this very
argument to God, even the conſideration of what
he had already done for them (as <hi>with</hi> what <hi>great
might and power, he had brought them out of</hi> AEgypt,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) thereby to move God to continue his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
unto them, ſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 11. and elſewhere,
And this overcame God, as you may read in
the 14. <hi>ver.</hi> of the fore-named <hi>Chap.</hi> Yea, ſo ſet was
<hi>Moſes</hi> his heart upon them, that he not only refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that former offer which God made him, but
he made an offer unto God of himſelfe, to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
his portion in life for their good: <hi>Rather</hi> (ſayes
he) <hi>blot me out of the book of life:</hi> So <hi>ver.</hi> 32.</p>
                        <p>And we may obſerve the like zealous love in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Paul,</hi> towards all thoſe converts of his, whom
in his Epiſtles he wrote unto; towards whom, that
which ſo much endeared his affections, was the
paines, the coſt, the travail, the care and the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
that hee had had in bringing them unto
Chriſt. Thus towards the <hi>Galatians,</hi> how ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:155276:165"/>
was he? how afraid to loſe his labour on
them? <hi>I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtowed upon
you labour in vain:</hi> ſo hee expreſſeth himſelfe,
<hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 11. and <hi>ver.</hi> 19. he utters himſelfe yet
more deepely; <hi>My little children</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>of whom
I again travaile in birth, untill Chriſt be formed in you.</hi>
He profeſſeth himſelfe content to be in travail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for them, rather then loſe that, about which
he had beene in travail for them once before.</p>
                        <p>Now from both theſe examples (whereof the
one was Chriſts Type, and the other the very
copy and patern of Chriſts heart) we may raiſe
up our hearts to the perſwaſion of that love and
affection which muſt needs be in the heart of
Chriſt, from that which he hath done and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
for us.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, For <hi>Moſes,</hi> did <hi>Moſes</hi> ever doe that for
that people, which Chriſt hath done and ſuffered
for you? He acknowledged that he had <hi>not borne
that people in his wombe,</hi> but Chriſt bare us all, and
we were the <hi>travaile of his ſoule,</hi> and for us he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
the <hi>birth-throws of death</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> calls
them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 24.) And then for <hi>Paul, was Paul
crucified for you?</hi> (ſayes <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe of himſelfe)
but Chriſt was, and he ſpeakes it the more to
enhaunce the love of Chriſt. Or if <hi>Paul</hi> had beene
crucified, would, or could it have profited us?
no; If therefore <hi>Paul</hi> was contented to have been
in travail again for the <hi>Galatians,</hi> when he feared
their falling away; then how doth Chriſts heart
worke much more towards ſinners? he having
put in ſo infinite a ſtock of ſufferings for us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:155276:165"/>
which he is loath to loſe; and hath ſo
much love to us beſides, that if we could ſuppoſe,
that otherwiſe we could not be ſaved, he could be
content to be in travail again, and to ſuffer for us
afreſh: But he needed to doe this but <hi>once</hi> (as the
Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks:) ſo <hi>perfect</hi> was
his Prieſthood. Be aſſured then, that his love
was not ſpent or worne out at his death, but
encreaſed by it. His love it was that cauſed him
to die, and to <hi>lay downe his life for his ſheep;</hi> and
<hi>greater love then this, hath no man,</hi> (ſaid himſelfe
before he did it.) But now having dyed, this
muſt needs cauſe him from his ſoul to cleave the
more unto them.</p>
                        <p>A cauſe, or a perſon that a man hath ſuffered
much for, according to the proportion of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
is ones love and zeale thereunto; for
theſe doe lay a ſtrong engagement upon a man:
becauſe otherwiſe he loſeth the thanks and the
honour of all that is already done and paſt by
him. <hi>Have you ſuffered ſo many things in vaine?</hi>
ſayes the Apoſtle to the Galathians, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 4.
where he makes a motive and an incitement of
it, that ſeeing they had endured ſo much for
Chriſt, and the profeſſion of him, they would
not now loſe all for want of doing a little more.
And doth not the ſame diſpoſition remaine in
Chriſt? eſpecially ſeeing the hard work is over
and diſpatcht which he was to doe on earth;
and that which now remaines for him to
doe in heaven, is farre more ſweet and full of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and as the <hi>reaping in joy,</hi> of what he had here
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:155276:166"/>
                           <hi>ſowne in teares.</hi> If his love was ſo great, as to hold
out the enduring ſo much; then now when that
brunt is over, and his love is become a tryed love,
will it not continue? If when tryed in adverſity,
(and that is the ſureſt and ſtrongeſt love) and in
the greateſt adverſity that ever was; if it then
held, will it not ſtill doe ſo in his proſperity
much more? Did his heart ſtick to us, and
by us in the greateſt temptation that ever was;
and will his glorious and proſperous eſtate take it
off, or abate his love unto us? Certainly no:
[<hi>Ieſus the ſame to day, yeſterday, and for ever.]
Heb.</hi> 13. 8. When he was in the midſt of his
paines, one for whom he was then a ſuffering,
ſaid unto him, <hi>Lord remember me when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt
into thy Kingdome;</hi> and could Chriſt mind
him then? (as you know he did, telling him,
<hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe</hi>) then
ſurely when Chriſt came to Paradiſe, he would
doe it much more; and remember him too, by
the ſureſt token that ever was, and which he can
never forget, namely, the paines which he was
then enduring for him. <hi>He remembers both them
and us ſtill,</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeaks of God.) And
if he would have us <hi>remember his death till hee
comes,</hi> ſo to cauſe our hearts to love him; then
certainly himſelfe doth it in heaven much more:
No queſtion but he remembers us, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to doe that good thiefe, now he <hi>is in his
Kingdome.</hi> And ſo much for this ſecond En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>
                        <p>A 3.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> engagement is the engagement of an <hi>Office,</hi>
                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:155276:166"/>
which ſtill lies upon him, and requires of him
all mercifulneſſe and graciouſneſſe towards ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
that doe come unto him. And therefore
whilſt he continues in that place, and inveſted
with that office, (as he for ever doth) his heart
muſt needs continue full of tenderneſſe and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels.
Now that office is the office of his <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;</hi>
which this Text mentions, as the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our encouragement to come <hi>boldly to the
Throne of grace, for grace and mercie,—ſeeing
we have a great High [Prieſt] entred into the
Heavens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Two things I am to ſhew, to make up this
Demonſtration:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, that this office of High-Prieſthood is
an office erected wholly for the ſhewing of grace
and mercie.</p>
                        <p>And ſecondly, that this office doth therefore
lay upon Chriſt a duty to be in all his diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
full of grace and mercie; and therefore his
heart remaines moſt certainly ſuited and framed
thereunto.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt. The office of High-Prieſthood
is altogether an office of grace: And I may call
it the <hi>Pardon-office,</hi> ſet up and erected by God in
heaven; and Chriſt, he is appointed the <hi>Lord</hi>
and <hi>Maſter</hi> of it. And as his <hi>Kingly office</hi> is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of <hi>power</hi> and <hi>dominion,</hi> and his <hi>Propheticall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
an office of <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>wiſdome;</hi> ſo his <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
office</hi> is an office of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercie.</hi> The High-Prieſts
office did properly deale in nothing elſe.
If there had not been a <hi>Mercie-ſeat</hi> in the Holy of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:155276:167"/>
Holies, the High-Prieſt had not at all been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to have gone into it. It was Mercie, and
Reconciliation, and Atonement for ſinners, that
he was to treat about, and ſo to officiate for at
the Mercie-ſeat; He had had otherwiſe no
worke, nor any thing to doe when he ſhould
come into the moſt holy place. Now this was
but a typicall alluſion unto this office of Chriſts
in heaven. And therefore the Apoſtle (in the
Text) when he ſpeaks of this our High-Prieſts
being entred into heaven, he makes mention
of a <hi>Throne of grace,</hi> and this in anſwer to
that in the Type both of the High-Prieſt of
old, and of the <hi>Mercie-ſeat</hi> in the Holy of Holies.
And further to confirme this, the Apoſtle goes
on to open that very Type, and to apply it
unto Chriſt, unto this very purpoſe which we
have now in hand: And this in the very next
words to my Text, <hi>Chap. 5. 1, 2, 3. verſes;</hi> in which
he gives a full deſcription of an <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> and
all the <hi>properties</hi> and requiſites that were to be
in him, together with the eminent and principall
<hi>end</hi> that that office was ordained for. Now the
great and eſſentiall <hi>qualifications</hi> there ſpecified;
that were to be in a High-Prieſt, are <hi>Mercie</hi> and
<hi>Grace,</hi> and the <hi>ends</hi> for which he is there ſaid to
be ordained, are works of <hi>Mercie</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi>
And beſides what the words in their ſingle ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
doe hold forth to this purpoſe; obſerve
that they come in to back and confirme that
exhortation in the Text, wherein he had ſet
forth Chriſt as an <hi>High-Prieſt touched with the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:155276:167"/>
feeling of infirmities;</hi> and that therefore we ſhould
<hi>come with boldneſſe for grace and mercy: for every
High-Prieſt</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>taken from among men is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for men in things pertaining to God: that he
may offer both gifts and ſacrifices for ſinne. One
who can have compaſsion, &amp;c.</hi> So that theſe words
are a confirmation of what hee had before
ſaid, and doe ſet out Chriſt the ſubſtance, in his
grace and mercifullneſſe, under <hi>Aaron</hi> and his
ſonnes the ſhadowes: and all this for the comfort
of beleevers.</p>
                        <p>Now 1. for the <hi>ends</hi> for which thoſe High-prieſts
were appointed, they ſpeak all nothing but grace
and mercy unto ſinners; it is ſaid, he was one <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
[for men,] to offer both gifts and ſacrifices
for ſins.</hi> There is both the <hi>finis cujus,</hi> the end for
<hi>whom,</hi> and the <hi>finis cui,</hi> the end for <hi>which</hi> he was
ordained.</p>
                        <p>1. For <hi>whom,</hi> He was ordained for <hi>men,</hi> that
is, for mens cauſe, and for their good: Had it not
beene for the ſalvation of men, God had never
made Chriſt a Prieſt. So that he is wholly to
employ all his intereſt and power for them,
for whoſe cauſe he was ordained a Prieſt, and
that in all things that are betweene God and
them. He is to tranſact <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, all things that
are to be done by us <hi>towards God,</hi> or for us <hi>with
God;</hi> he is to take up all our quarrels with
God, and to mediate a reconciliation between
us and him; He is to procure us all favour from
God, and to doe all that which God would have
done for our ſalvation. And that he might doe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:155276:168"/>
this willingly, kindly, and naturally for us, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
High-Prieſt was <hi>taken from among men;</hi> ſo
was Chriſt, that he might be a Prieſt of our own
kinde, and ſo be more kind unto us, then the nature
of an Angel could have been. And how much
this conduceth to his being a mercifull High-Prieſt,
I ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
                        <p>2. The end for <hi>which</hi> every High-Prieſt was
ordained, ſhews this. He was to <hi>offer gifts and
ſacrifices for ſinnes: Sacrifices for ſins,</hi> to pacifie
Gods wrath againſt ſinne, and <hi>gifts</hi> to procure
his favour. You know the Apoſtle in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words had mentioned <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercie,</hi> and
encouraged us to come with boldneſſe unto this
High-Prieſt for both; and anſwerably, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
us the more, he ſayes, the High-Prieſt by
his office was to offer for both; <hi>Gifts</hi> for to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
all <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>ſacrifices</hi> to procure all <hi>mercie</hi>
for us, in reſpect of our <hi>ſins.</hi> Thus you ſee the
ends which he is ordained for, are all matter of
grace and mercie, and ſo of encouragement unto
men for the obtaining of both, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
                        <p>3. The <hi>qualification</hi> that was required in a High-Prieſt,
was, that he ſhould be <hi>one that could have
compaſsion, &amp;c.</hi> and this is ſet forth, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. He that
was High-Prieſt, was not choſen into that office
for his deep wiſdome, great power, or exact ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe;
but for the mercie and compaſſion that
was in him. That is it which is here made the
ſpeciall (and therefore the onely mentioned)
property in an High-Prieſt, <hi>as ſuch;</hi> and the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall
and eſſentiall qualification that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:155276:168"/>
and internally to conſtitute him, and fit
him for that office: as Gods appointment did,
outwardly and externally, as <hi>ver.</hi> 4. hath it. And
the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,] <hi>[that can,</hi> or <hi>is able]</hi> imports
an inward faculty, a ſpirit, a diſpoſition, a heart
that knowes how to be compaſſionate. And it is
the ſame word that the Apoſtle had before uſed,
to expreſſe Chriſts heart by, even in the words
of the Text, [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>] that is, <hi>[Who can
be toucht with the feeling of our infirmities.]</hi> And he
had alſo uſed it of him afore that, in the point of
mercy, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 18. [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, &amp;c.] <hi>[he is able] to</hi>
ſuccour, &amp;c. which is not meant of any externall
power, (which we uſually call <hi>Ability</hi>) but of an
internall touch in his will; He hath an <hi>heart able</hi>
to forgive, and to afford help.</p>
                        <p>Now therefore if this be ſo eſſentiall a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to an High-Prieſt <hi>as ſuch;</hi> then it is in Chriſt
moſt eminently. And as Chriſt had not been fit
to have been Gods <hi>King,</hi> if he had not had all
power and ſtrength in him, which is eſſentiall to
conſtitute him a King; ſo nor to have been Gods
<hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> if he had not had ſuch an <hi>heart</hi> for
mercifulneſſe; yea, and no longer to have beene
a Prieſt, then he ſhould continue to have ſuch a
heart. Even as that which internally qualifies a
<hi>Miniſter</hi> for the miniſtery is his <hi>gifts,</hi> which if he
loſeth, hee is no longer to be in that office: Or,
as reaſon makes a man a <hi>man,</hi> which if hee
loſeth hee becomes a beaſt: Thus no longer
ſhould Chriſt continue to be a Prieſt, then he
hath an heart that <hi>can have compaſsion,</hi> (as this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:155276:169"/>
verſe hath it.) And the word which we
tranſlate <hi>[to have compaſsion]</hi> is exceeding em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall,
and the force of it obſervable; it is in
the Originall [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>] and ſignifies <hi>[to have
compaſsion according to every ones meaſure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.]</hi>
He had ſaid of Chriſt in the words of
my text, that he was <hi>toucht with the feeling of our
infirmities,</hi> or that, <hi>he had a ſuffering with us in all
our evills:</hi> and this word alſo here uſed imports a
<hi>ſuffering:</hi> But then, ſome greatly diſtreſſed ſoules
might queſtion thus; Though he pities me, and
is affected, yet my miſery and ſins being great,
will he take them in to the full, lay them to heart,
to pity me according to the greatneſſe of them?
To meete with this thought therefore, and to
prevent even this objection about Chriſts pity,
the Apoſtle ſets him out by what was the duty of
the High-Prieſt who was his ſhadow; that he is
one that <hi>can have compaſsion according to the meaſure
of every ones diſtreſſe;</hi> and one that conſiders
every circumſtance in it, and will accordingly
afford his pity and help, and if it be <hi>great,</hi> he hath
a <hi>great fellow-feeling</hi> of it, for he is a <hi>great High-Prieſt:</hi>
Thy <hi>miſery</hi> can never exceed his <hi>mercy.</hi> The
word here uſed comes from [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>] a <hi>meaſure,</hi>
and [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>] to <hi>ſuffer.</hi> And that it is the Apoſtles
ſcope to hold this forth in this word, is evident by
what follows, for he on purpoſe makes mention
of thoſe ſeverall degrees, proportions, and
ranks of ſinners under the old Law, who were
capable of mercy and compaſſion, <hi>who can have
compaſsion</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>on the [ignorant,] and on
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:155276:169"/>
them that are [out of the way.]</hi> In the old Law you
may read of ſeverall degrees and kinds of ſinnes,
for which God appointed or <hi>meaſured</hi> out differing
and proportionable ſacrifices. So for ſinnes of
<hi>ignorance</hi> there was one kind of ſacrifice, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.
<hi>ver. 2. &amp;</hi> 5. and another for ſinnes <hi>againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
or ſuch as were wittingly committed, <hi>Ch.</hi> 6.
<hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Now when any
ſinner came to the High-prieſt to make atonement
for him, the Prieſt was wiſely to conſider the kind
and the proportion of his ſin; as whether it were a
ſin of meer ignorance, or whether it were againſt
knowledge, and accordingly he was to proportion
a ſacrifice, and to mediate for him: And ſo he did
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>pity him according to meaſure,</hi> or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>reaſon</hi> or diſcretion, (as in the margent it
is varied.) And therefore the Apoſtle here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
both <hi>the ignorant,</hi> (that is, thoſe that ſinne
out of meere ignorance) and <hi>them that are gone
out of the way,</hi> namely, by wilfull and witting ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
And ſo by this property that was to be in
the High-prieſt, doth he here ſet forth Chriſt. As
the meaſure of any mans need and diſtreſſe is
from ſin and miſery, accordingly is he affected
towards him. And as we have ſinnes of ſeverall
ſizes; accordingly hath he mercies, and puts forth
a mediation proportionable; whether they be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances,
or ſins of daily incurſion, or elſe ſinnes
more groſſe and preſumptuous. And therefore
let neither of them diſcourage any from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
unto Chriſt for grace and mercie.</p>
                        <p>So that (for the cloſure of this) here is both
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:155276:170"/>
the <hi>qualification</hi> diſpoſing him for this office, a
<hi>mercifull compaſsionateneſſe;</hi> and here are the ends
of this office, even to deale mercifully with all
ſorts of ſinners <hi>according to the proportion</hi> and <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
of their ſinnes and miſeries. From each of
which doe ariſe theſe Corollaries, which make
up the demonſtration in hand, as the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
1. That he is no longer fit for this
place, then he continues to be of a gracious
diſpoſion, and one that <hi>can have compaſsion.</hi>
2. That he can no longer be <hi>faithfull</hi> in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of this office, (according to the ends for
which it was appointed) then he ſhews all grace
and mercy unto them that come unto his throne
of grace for it.</p>
                        <p>And that is the ſecond thing which I at firſt
propounded; that this office did lay a <hi>duty</hi> upon
him to have <hi>compaſsion:</hi> And it neceſſarily follows
from the former. And anſwerably to confirme
this, we have both theſe two brought to our
hands in one place together, (and which is a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
place to this laſt interpreted) it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17.
<hi>[That he might be a mercifull and a faithfull High-prieſt,
&amp;c.]</hi> He is at once here ſaid to be both
<hi>mercifull</hi> and <hi>faithfull:</hi> And both are attributed to
him, in reſpect of this High-prieſts office, <hi>[faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
[High-Prieſt:]</hi> and that, as it is to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
in heaven, after the dayes of his fleſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
For the Apoſtle giving the reaſon of it, and
ſhewing what it is that fits him to be ſuch an
High-Prieſt, addes, <hi>ver. 18. [In that himſelfe
[hath] ſuffered:]</hi> ſo that it relates to the time
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:155276:170"/>
after his ſufferings ended. Now in that he is ſaid
to be <hi>[mercifull,]</hi> this relates to that internall
diſpoſition of his heart, (before ſpoken of) qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
him for this office; and in that he is ſaid
to be <hi>[faithfull,]</hi> that reſpects his execution of it;
he is faithfull in the diſcharge of the duty which
that place layes on him.</p>
                        <p>So then, this goes further then the former, for
it ſhews, that to exerciſe mercy, is the duty of his
place, and that, if he will be <hi>faithfull,</hi> he muſt be
<hi>mercifull.</hi> For <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> in any office, imports
an exact performance of ſomething appointed by
him, who deſignes one to that office, and that
as a duty: and that this is a true deſcription of
<hi>faithfulneſſe,</hi> and alſo that this <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
is in Chriſt, we have at once implyed, in
that which immediately follows in the beginning
of the 3. <hi>Chap. v. 3. Who was</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on to ſpeak of Chriſt) <hi>faithfull to him that appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, as Moſes alſo was faithfull in all his houſe:</hi>
we have the ſame thing as expreſly ſpoken in that
forequoted place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. (in the next words to thoſe
we even now opened,) <hi>ver. 3. And by reaſon hereof
[he ought] to offer for ſins:—</hi> he ſpeaks it of Chriſts
Type, the High-Prieſt, (as the former alſo he
had done) But thereby to ſhew that it is Chriſts
duty alſo to mediate for all that come to him,
<hi>He ought to doe it.</hi> Now then to enforce this
conſideration, for the help of our faith herein;
If this office doth by Gods appointment thus
bind him to it, and if it be the duty of his place,
then certainly he will performe it moſt exactly,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:155276:171"/>
for elſe he doth not doe his duty. And our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
may be, that his <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> lies in being mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull;
therefore (you ſee) they are both here
joyned together. Every one is to doe the proper
duty of his place, and exactly to ſee to that And
therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. exhorting to the
diſcharge of the duties of each office in the
Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. he ſayes, <hi>Let him that hath a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery</hi>
committed to him, <hi>wait on his miniſtery;</hi>
and (among others) if his place of miniſtration
be to <hi>ſhew mercy,</hi> (as <hi>ver.</hi> 8.) (which was an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in the Church, upon which lyed the care of
the <hi>poore</hi> and <hi>ſick</hi>) he is <hi>to doe it with cheerfulneſſe.</hi>
And ſo ſayes Chriſt of himſelfe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1, 2.
<hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, to bind up the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
hearted, to open the priſon doores to them that are
bound,</hi> (to viſit and relieve them) <hi>and to preach
good tidings to the meeke.</hi> Such kind of ſoules are
they that he hath the charge of. He is <hi>the great
Shepheard and Biſhop of ſoules, 1 Pet. 2. ult.</hi> and the
<hi>ſick,</hi> and the <hi>broken,</hi> they are his ſheep, his charge,
his Dioceſe, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hath it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 34. 16. And
to tend ſuch as theſe, he looks for ever upon it
as his duty, as his owne expreſſion upon the
like occaſion importeth, in <hi>Iohn 10. 16. Other
ſheep I have,</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>them I [muſt] bring,
&amp;c.</hi> Obſerve how he puts a [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>] an [<hi>I muſt</hi>]
upon it; looking at it as his duty, ſtrictly laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him by his place of being a Shepheard. And
the proper duty of his place being <hi>to ſhew mercy,</hi>
he doth it <hi>with cheerfulneſſe,</hi> (as the Apoſtle
ſpeaks:) For Mercie makes one doe what they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:155276:171"/>
doe, with cheerfulneſſe. And Chriſt, as he is
the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> ſo the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the <hi>Deacon</hi> alſo,
(for he beares all offices to his Church) as of
the <hi>circumciſion,</hi> ſo of the <hi>uncircumciſion</hi> alſo:
ſo he is called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8. And theſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>High-Prieſt, Shepheard, Biſhop, &amp;c.</hi> he
hath ſtill in heaven; for <hi>he continues a Prieſt for ever,
Heb.</hi> 7. 24.</p>
                        <p>Now therefore to conclude this Head: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
feare that Chriſts great advancement in
heaven, ſhould any whit alter his diſpoſition;
for this his very advancement engageth him the
more. For although he be <hi>entred into the heavens;</hi>
yet conſider withall that it is here added, [to be
an <hi>High-Prieſt</hi>] there; and ſo long, feare not: for
his place it ſelfe will call for mercie from him
unto them that treat with him about it. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in the heavens he be <hi>advanced far above
all principalities and powers,</hi> yet ſtill his High-Prieſthood
goes with him, and accompanies him:
For <hi>ſuch an High-Prieſt became us, as was higher
then the heavens, Heb.</hi> 7. 26. And further, though
he ſits at Gods right hand, and on his Fathers
Throne, yet that Throne it is a <hi>Throne of grace,</hi>
(as the Text hath it) upon which he ſits. And as
the <hi>Mercie-ſeat</hi> in the Type was the fartheſt and
higheſt thing in the Holy of Holies; ſo the <hi>Throne
of grace</hi> (which is an infinite encouragement unto
us) is the higheſt ſeat in heaven. So that if Chriſt
will have, and keep the greateſt place in heaven,
the higheſt preferment that heaven it ſelfe can
beſtow upon him, it engageth him unto grace
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:155276:172"/>
and mercy. The higheſt honour there hath this
Attribute of <hi>Grace</hi> annexed to it in its very title,
[<hi>A Throne of Grace:</hi>] And as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>A Kings
Throne is eſtabliſhed by righteouſneſſe,</hi> it continues
firme by it; ſo is Chriſts Throne by <hi>Grace.</hi> Grace
was both the firſt founder of his Throne, or his
raiſer to it, and alſo it is the eſtabliſher of it.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, it is the <hi>founder</hi> of it; For the reaſon why
God did ſet him up in that place, was, becauſe he
had more grace and mercy in his heart, then all
the creatures had, or could be capable of. All
Favourites are uſually raiſed for ſomething that
is eminent in them, either beauty, pleaſantneſſe
of wit, State-policie, or the like. Now if you
aske what moved God to advance Chriſt to this
high Throne, it was his grace: So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 3.
[<hi>Grace] is poured into thy lips,</hi> (and ſo dwels much
more in his heart) [<hi>Therefore] God hath bleſſed thee:</hi>
(ſo it followes:) namely, with all thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in heaven (which are Gods bleſſing to his
Sonne.)</p>
                        <p>And then ſecondly, Grace is the <hi>upholder</hi> of
his Throne: ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 4. of the aforeſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.
<hi>In thy majeſty—proſper thou;</hi> as well <hi>becauſe of
meekneſſe,</hi> as of <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and alſo becauſe of
<hi>Truth;</hi> that is, the word of truth, the Goſpel of
our ſalvation, (as <hi>Paul</hi> exegetically expoundeth it,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13.) Theſe are the pillars and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of his throne and majeſty: And there are <hi>two</hi>
of them, you ſee, that are of <hi>grace, (meekneſſe,</hi> and
the <hi>Goſpel of our ſalvation</hi>) unto <hi>one</hi> of <hi>juſtice,</hi> or
<hi>righteouſneſſe;</hi> and yet that one is for us too. And
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:155276:172"/>
theſe <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> Chriſts Throne: So it followes,
<hi>verſe 6. Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi>
And you know who applies this unto
Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8. Feare not then, when as
<hi>meekneſſe</hi> ſupports his <hi>majeſty,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> his <hi>throne;</hi>
and when as he holds his place by ſhewing theſe.
And thus much from that office that is laid upon
Chriſt as he is a <hi>Prieſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A fourth engagement,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> which added to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
may mightily help our faith in this, is, his
<hi>owne Intereſt;</hi> both in that our ſalvation is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
of his bloud; and alſo that his owne joy,
comfort, happineſſe, and glory are encreaſed
and enlarged by his ſhewing grace and mercy,
in pardoning, relieving, and comforting his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
here on earth, under all their infirmities. So
that, beſides the obligation of an office underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by him for us, there is the addition of a
mighty intereſt of his owne, coincident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
to fixe his heart unto <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> for us, in
all that doth concern us. We ſee that Advocates
and Atturneys who plead for others, although
that they have no ſhare in the eſtate for which
they plead, no title to, or intereſt therein; yet
when they have undertaken a Clients cauſe, (if
honeſt) how diligent will they be to promote
and carry it for <hi>that</hi> their Client, ſimply becauſe
it is their office, and the duty of their place; and
yet they have but a very ſmall Fee given them,
in compariſon of that eſtate which oft times they
follow ſuit about: How much more would their
diligence be whetted, if the Lands and Eſtates
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:155276:173"/>
they ſue for, were their own, or a purchaſe of
theirs for their wives joynture, or childrens por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
Now ſuch is the pardoning of our ſins, the
ſalvation of our ſoules, and the comforting of our
hearts unto Chriſt; theſe are the purchaſe of
Chriſts blood, and whilſt he is exerciſed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
theſe, he doth good to his own child and
Spouſe, &amp;c. which is in effect a doing good unto
himſelfe. Yea, to doe theſe, bringeth in to himſelfe
more comfort and glory, then it procures to
them. And therefore the Apoſtle in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the following Chapter, (namely, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.)
ſayes, that Chriſt is engaged to <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> in
the execution of his office, not as a meere <hi>ſervant</hi>
onely, who is betruſted by his Maſter, but as
an <hi>owner,</hi> who hath an intereſt of poſſeſſion
in the things committed to his care, and a revenue
from theſe: So <hi>ver. 5. Moſes verily</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>was
faithfull as a ſervant in Gods houſe; but Chriſt as a
Son over his owne houſe,</hi> (that is, as an Heire of all)
<hi>Whoſe houſe</hi> (or family) <hi>are We,</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle,)
<hi>ver.</hi> 6. If a Phyſitian for his fee will be faithfull,
although he be a ſtranger; much more will he be
ſo if he be Father to the Patient, (ſo as his own life
and comfort are bound up in that of the childs)
or when much of his eſtate and commings in
are from the life of the party unto whom he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
phyſick: In ſuch a caſe they ſhall be ſure
to want for no care and coſt, and to lack no
Cordials that will comfort them, no means that
will cure them, and keep them healthfull, and no
fit diet that may nouriſh and ſtrengthen them.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:155276:173"/>
As the care of that Prince of the Eunuchs, in the
firſt of <hi>Daniel,</hi> was, to have thoſe children com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his charge, to eat and drink of the beſt,
becauſe that on their looks and good liking his
place depended: Now ſo God hath ordered it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for an everlaſting obligation of Chriſts heart
unto us, that his giving grace, mercy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to us, is one great part of his glory, and of
the revenue of his happineſſe in heaven, and of
his inheritance there.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, to explaine how this may be, conſider,
That the Humane nature of Chriſt in heaven hath
a double capacity of glory, happineſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
One in that neere fellowſhip and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with his Father, and the other Perſons,
through his perſonall union with the Godhead.
Which joy of his in this fellowſhip, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſpeaks of, <hi>Pſal. 16. ver. ult.</hi> as to be enjoyed
by him, <hi>In thy preſence is [fulneſſe of joy,] and at thy
right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> And this is a
conſtant and ſetled fulneſſe of pleaſure; ſuch as
admits not any addition or diminution, but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
one and the ſame, and abſolute and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
in it ſelfe; and of it ſelfe alone ſufficient for
the Sonne of God, and Heyre of all things to
live upon, though he ſhould have had no other
commings in of joy and delight from any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And this is his naturall inheritance.</p>
                        <p>But God hath beſtowed upon him another ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of glory, and a revenue of pleaſure to come
in another way; and (anſwerably) another <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
namely, from his Church and Spouſe,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:155276:174"/>
which is his Body. Thus <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
had ſpoke the higheſt things of Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall
advancement in heaven that could be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
as of his <hi>ſitting downe at Gods right hand far
above all principalities and powers, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 20, 21.
yet <hi>ver.</hi> 22. he addes this unto all, <hi>And gave
him to be an Head to the Church, which is his Body, the
[fulneſſe] of him who filleth all in all.</hi> So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he of himſelfe perſonally be ſo full, (the
fulneſſe of the God-head dwelling in him) that
he overflowes to the filling all things; yet he is
pleaſed to account (and it is ſo in the reality)
his Church and the ſalvation of it to be another
<hi>fulneſſe</hi> unto him, ſuper-added unto the former.
As Sonne of God he is compleat, and that of
himſelfe; but as an Head, he yet hath another
additionall fulneſſe of joy from the good and
happineſſe of his members. And as all pleaſure is
the companion, and the reſult of action; ſo this
ariſeth unto him, from his exerciſing acts of
grace, and from his continuall doing good unto,
and for thoſe his members; or (as the Apoſtle
expreſſeth it) from his <hi>filling them</hi> with all mercy,
grace, comfort, and felicity; Himſelfe becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
yet more <hi>full,</hi> by <hi>filling</hi> them; and this is
his inheritance alſo, as that other was. So as a
double inheritance Chriſt hath to live upon; One
<hi>perſonall,</hi> and due unto him (as he is the Son of
God) the firſt moment of his Incarnation, ere he
had wrought any one piece of work towards our
ſalvation: Another acquired, purchaſed, and
merited by his having performed that great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:155276:174"/>
and obedience: And certainly, beſides the
glory of his perſon, there is the glory of his office,
of Mediatorſhip, and of Headſhip to his Church:
And though he is never ſo full of himſelfe, yet
he deſpiſeth not this part of his revenue that
comes in from below. Thus much for explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Now ſecondly, for the confirmation and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up the demonſtration in hand. This ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added
glory and happineſſe of Chriſt is enlarged
and encreaſed, ſtill as his members come to have
the purchaſe of his death more and more laid
forth upon them: So as when their ſins are
pardoned, their hearts more ſanctified, and
their ſpirits comforted, then comes Hee to ſee
the fruit of his labour, and is comforted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
for he is the more glorified by it: yea he is
much more pleaſed and rejoyced in this, then
themſelves can be. And this muſt needs keep
up in his heart his care and love unto his children
here below, to <hi>water</hi> and refreſh them <hi>every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
(as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 37. 3.) For in thus
putting forth acts of grace and favour, and in
doing good unto them, he doth but good unto
himſelfe; which is the ſureſt engagement in the
world. And therefore the Apoſtle exhorts men
to love their wives, upon this ground, that in ſo
doing, they <hi>love themſelves: (Epheſ. 5. 28. So
ought men to love their wives, as their own bodies:
He that loveth his wife, loveth himſelfe:</hi>) ſo ſtrict
and neere is that relation. Now the ſame doth
hold true of Chriſt in his loving his Church. And
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:155276:175"/>
therefore in the ſame place, the love of Chriſt
unto his Church is held forth as the patterne and
exemplar of ours, ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 25. [<hi>Even as Chriſt alſo
loved the Church.</hi>] And ſo it may well be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thence by comparing the one ſpeech with
the other, that Chriſt in loving his Church, doth
but love himſelfe; and then the more love and
grace he ſhews unto the Members of that his
Body, the more he ſhews love unto himſelfe.
And accordingly it is further added there, <hi>ver.</hi> 27.
that he daily <hi>waſheth and cleanſeth his Church,</hi> (that
is, both from the guilt and power of ſinne,) <hi>that
he might preſent it to [himſelfe] a glorious Church,
not having ſpot or wrinkle, &amp;c.</hi> Obſerve, it is to
[<hi>himſelfe.</hi>] So that all that he doth for his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
is for himſelfe, as truly, yea more fully
then for them; and his ſhare of glory out of theirs
is greater then theirs, by how much the glory
of the cauſe is greater then <hi>that</hi> of the effect.
And thus indeed the Scripture ſpeaks of it: as,
whilſt it calls the Saints the <hi>glory of Chriſt:</hi> So
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23. And Chriſt, in <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 13. and <hi>ver.</hi>
22, 23. ſayes, that he is <hi>glorified in them.</hi> And
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. where Chriſt is ſet forth as <hi>Solomon</hi> in all
his royalty and majeſtie; yet <hi>ver.</hi> 11. hee is
ſaid <hi>greatly to deſire</hi> or <hi>delight</hi> in the <hi>beauty</hi> of
his Queene: that is, the graces of the Saints; and
that not with an ordinary delight, but he <hi>greatly
deſires;</hi> his deſire is encreaſed as her beauty
is: For that is there brought in as a motive unto
her to be more holy and conformed unto him,
<hi>to encline her care, and forſake her Fathers houſe, v.</hi> 10.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:155276:175"/>
[<hi>So] ſhall the King greatly deſire thy beauty.</hi> Chriſt
hath a beauty that pleaſeth him, as well as we
have, though of another kind; and therefore
ceaſeth not till he hath got out every <hi>ſpot</hi> &amp; <hi>wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle</hi>
out of his Spouſes face, (as we heard the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſpeake even now) <hi>ſo to preſent her glorious unto
himſelfe;</hi> that is, delightfull and pleaſing in his eye.
And ſuitably unto this (to confirme us yet more
in it,) Chriſt in that Sermon which was his
ſolemne fare-well before his going to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
aſſures his Diſciples that his heart would
be ſo farre from being weaned from them,
that his joy would ſtill be in them, to ſee
them proſper and bring forth fruit; ſo JOHN
15. 9, 10, 11. where his ſcope is to aſſure them of
the continuance of his love unto them when he
ſhould be gone; ſo <hi>ver. 9, 10. As my Father hath
loved me, ſo have I loved you. Continue in my love,
&amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Feare not you my love,
nor the continuance of it in my abſence; but looke
you to doe your duty, &amp;c. And to give them aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of this, he further tels them, that even when
he is in heaven, in the greateſt fulneſſe of pleaſure
at Gods right hand, yet even then his <hi>joy will be in
them,</hi> and in their well doing; ſo <hi>ver. 11. Theſe
things have I ſpoken unto you that my joy may remaine
in you, and that your joy may be full.</hi> He ſpeakes juſt
like a Father that is taking his leave of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and comforting them at his departure, and
giving them good counſell, to take good courſes
when he is gone from them, <hi>to keepe his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi>
and to <hi>love one another,</hi> ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 10, &amp; 12.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:155276:176"/>
and backs it with this motive, ſo ſhall <hi>my joy
remain in you,</hi> (it is as Fathers uſe to ſpeake) and
it will be for your good too, <hi>your joy will be</hi> alſo
<hi>full.</hi> To open which words a little, the word
[<hi>remaine</hi>] uſed concerning their <hi>abiding in his
love,</hi> and his <hi>joy abiding</hi> in them, is uſed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the continuing of both theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them in heaven. And when Chriſt ſayes,
<hi>That my joy may remain in you,</hi> it is as if he had
ſaid, that I may even in heaven have cauſe
to rejoice in you, when I ſhall heare and know
of you, that you agree and are loving each to
other, and keepe my Commandements. The
joy which he there calls <hi>His</hi> joy, [<hi>My] joy,</hi> is
not to be underſtood <hi>Objectivè,</hi> of <hi>Their</hi> joy in
<hi>Him,</hi> as the object of it: but <hi>Subjectiè,</hi> of the
joy that ſhould bee in himſelfe, and which hee
ſhould have in them. So <hi>Auguſtine</hi> long ſince
interpreted it. <hi>Quodnam</hi> (ſayes hee) <hi>eſt illud
gaudium Chriſti [in nobis,] niſi quod ille dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur
gaudere [de nobis?</hi>] what is Chriſts joy
<hi>in us,</hi> but that which hee vouchſafeth to have
of and <hi>for us?</hi> And it is evident by this, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
if it were their joy which hee meant
in that firſt ſentence, then that other that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
[<hi>And your joy ſhall be ful</hi>] were a Tautologie.
He ſpeakes therefore of his joy and theirs, as
of two diſtinct things: and both together were
the greateſt motives that could be given to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
and quicken his Diſciples in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Now take an eſtimate of Chriſts heart
herein, from thoſe two holy Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:155276:176"/>
                           <hi>John,</hi> who were ſmaller reſemblances of this in
Chriſt. What (next to immediate communion with
Chriſt himſelfe) was the greateſt joy they had
to live upon in this world, but onely the fruit
of their Miniſtery appearing in the graces both
of the lives and hearts of ſuch as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
unto Chriſt? See how <hi>Paul</hi> utters him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
1 <hi>Theſ. 2. 19. What is our hope,</hi> (ſayes hee)
<hi>or joy, or crowne of rejoycing? Ye are our glory and
our joy, ver.</hi> 20. And in the 3. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> of JOHN,
<hi>ver. 3. John</hi> ſayes the like, that hee <hi>greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced</hi>
of that good teſtimony hee had heard of
<hi>Gaius: For</hi> (ſayes hee) <hi>I have no greater joy then
to heare that my children walk in the truth, ver.</hi> 4.
Now what were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi> but inſtruments
by whom they beleeved and were begotten? and
not on whom: Neither of theſe were crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for them; nor were theſe children of theirs
<hi>the travaile of their ſoules:</hi> How much more then
unto Chriſt, (whoſe intereſt in us and our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
is ſo infinitely much greater) muſt his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
be his joy and his crown? And to ſee them
to come in to him for grace and mercy, and
to <hi>walke in truth,</hi> rejoyceth him much more;
for he thereby <hi>ſees of the travaile of his ſoule,</hi>
and ſo is <hi>ſatisfied.</hi> Certainly what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes
of Parents, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 1. that <hi>a wiſe ſon maketh
a glad father, &amp;c.</hi> is much more true of Chriſt.
Holineſſe, and fruitfulneſſe, and comfortable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in our ſpirits while we are here below, doe

And if part of his joy ariſe from hence, that
we thrive and doe well; then doubt not of
the continuance of his affections: for love
unto himſelfe will continue them towards us,
and readineſſe to embrace and receive them
when they come for grace and mercy.</p>
                        <p>There is a fift Engagement,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> which his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
having our nature, (which he ſtill weares in
heaven) and which the end or intention which
God had in ordaining Chriſts aſſuming it doe put
upon him for ever: For one great end and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of that perſonall union of our nature unto
the Godhead in the ſecond Perſon for ever, was,
that he might be a <hi>mercifull High-Prieſt.</hi> So that
as his <hi>office</hi> layes it as a duty upon him, ſo his
becomming a <hi>Man,</hi> qualifies him for that office,
and the performance of it, (and ſo may afford
a farther demonſtration of the point in hand.)
This we find both to have beene a <hi>requiſite</hi> in
our High-Prieſt, to qualifie him the better for
mercy and bowels; and alſo one of thoſe great
<hi>ends</hi> which God had in that aſſumption of our
nature.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, a <hi>requiſite,</hi> on purpoſe to make him the
more <hi>mercifull.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 1. (the place even now
inſiſted on, when yet this primary qualification I
then paſſed over, and reſerved unto this mention)
it is ſaid, <hi>Every High-Prieſt [taken from among men]
is ordained for men,</hi> (and that, to this end) <hi>that ſo
he might be one that can have compaſsion:</hi> namely,
with a pity that is naturall and kindly; ſuch as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:155276:179"/>
a man beares to one of his owne kind: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Angels would have made higher and
greater High-Prieſts then one of our nature; but
then they would not have pityed men, as men doe
their brethren, of the ſame kind and nature with
them.</p>
                        <p>And ſecondly, this was alſo Gods <hi>end</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
in ordaining Chriſts aſſumption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which that other place before cited, (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16, 17.) holds forth; <hi>Verily he took not
on him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi>
That is, an humane nature, and that made
too of the ſame ſtuffe that ours is of, and <hi>it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved

                           </gap>].
<hi>To the end hee might become,</hi> or <hi>be made
mercifull.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But was not the Son of God as mercifull (may
ſome ſay) without the taking of our nature, as
afterwards when he had aſſumed it? Or is his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
thereby made larger then of it ſelfe it ſhould
have beene, had he not tooke the humane nature
on him?</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, Yes, he is as mercifull, but yet</p>
                        <p>1. Hereby is held forth an evident demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that he will be mercifull unto men, who
are of his owne nature, and that for ever: For as
his union with our nature is for everlaſting; ſo
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:155276:180"/>
thereby is ſealed up to us the continuation of theſe
his mercies, to be for everlaſting: So that he can,
and will no more ceaſe to be mercifull to men,
then himſelfe can now ceaſe to be a man, which
can never be. And this was the end of that aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                        <p>But ſecondly, that was not all: His taking our
nature not onely addes unto our faith, but
ſome way or other even to his being mercifull.
Therefore it is ſaid, [<hi>That he might be made mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,
&amp;c.</hi>] That is, mercifull in ſuch a way,
as otherwiſe God of himſelfe alone had never
beene; namely, even [<hi>as a man.</hi>] So that this
union of both natures, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by God to make up the rareſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
of grace and mercie in the reſult of it, that
ever could have beene; and thereby fully fitted
and accommodated to the healing and ſaving of
our ſoules. The greatneſſe of that mercy that was
in God, that contributes the ſtock and treaſury of
thoſe mercies to be beſtowed on us: and unto the
greatneſſe of theſe mercies nothing is, or could
be added, by the humane nature aſſumed; but
rather, Chriſts Manhood had all his largeneſſe of
mercie from the Deity: So that had he not had
the mercies of God to enlarge his heart towards
us, he could never have held out to have for ever
been mercifull unto us. But then, this humane
nature aſſumed, <hi>that addes a new way</hi> of being mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull:
It aſſimilates all theſe mercies, and
makes them the mercies of a <hi>Man:</hi> it makes
them humane mercies, and ſo gives a natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:155276:180"/>
and kindlineſſe unto them to our capacities.
So that God doth now in as kindly and as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
a way pity us, who are fleſh of his fleſh
and bone of his bone, as a man pities a man:
Thereby to encourage us to come to him, and
to bee familiar with God, and treat with him
for grace and mercie, as a man would doe with a
man; as knowing, that in that man Chriſt Jeſus
(whom we beleeve upon) God dwels, and his
mercies worke in and through his heart in an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
way.</p>
                        <p>I will no longer inſiſt upon this notion now,
becauſe I ſhall have occaſion to touch upon it
againe, and adde unto it under that next third
generall Head, of ſhewing the <hi>way how</hi> Chriſts
heart is affected towards ſinners: Onely take
we notice, what comfort this may afford un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our faith, that Chriſt muſt ceaſe to bee a
man, if he continue not to be mercifull; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the very plot of his becomming a man,
was, that hee might bee mercifull unto us,
and that in a way ſo familiar to our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
as our owne hearts give the experience
of the like, which otherwiſe (as God) hee
was not capable of. And adde but this bold
word to it (though a true one) that he may
now as ſoon ceaſe to bee God, as to bee a man.
The humane nature, (after he had once aſſumed
it) being raiſed up to all the naturall rights of
the Son of God; whereof one (and that now made
naturall unto him) is, to continue for ever uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:155276:181"/>
And he may as ſoone ceaſe to be either,
as to be ready to ſhew mercy. So that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſcope of Chriſts office, but alſo the
intention of his aſſuming our nature,
doth lay a farther engagement
upon him, and that more
ſtrong then any, or
then all the
former.</p>

how ſuch affections come to be let into his heart,

propounded to be handled, as being neceſſary both
for the opening and clearing the words of the
Text, (which mainly hold forth this) as alſo for
the clearing of the thing it ſelfe, the point in hand.
For (as I there ſhewed) theſe words come in by
way of pre-occupation or prevention of an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
a sif his ſtate now in heaven were not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of ſuch affections as ſhould tenderly move him
to pity &amp; commiſeration, he being now glorified
both in ſoule and body. Which thought, becauſe
it was apt to ariſe in all mens minds, the Apoſtle
therefore fore-ſtalls it, both by affirming the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
[<hi>We have not an High-Prieſt that cannot be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
&amp;c.</hi>] that is, he both <hi>can be,</hi> (or, is capable of
it) and likewiſe <hi>is</hi> touched, notwithſtanding all his
glory; as alſo by his annexing the reaſon of it,
or ſhewing the way how it comes to paſſe, in that
<hi>in all points he was tempted like as we are.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now in handling and opening theſe, (which
is a matter full of difficulty) I ſhall with all wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe
proceed to the diſcovery of what manner
of affection in Chriſt this is, and that by theſe
ſteps and degrees.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="111" facs="tcp:155276:182"/>
1. This affection of compaſſion, or his being
<hi>touched with the feeling of our infirmities,</hi> is not
wholly to be underſtood in a metaphoricall or a
ſimilitudinary ſenſe, as thoſe ſpeeches uſed of
God in the Old Teſtament are to be underſtood,
when <hi>bowels</hi> of compaſſion are attributed unto
him, and his <hi>bowels</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>rowled together;</hi>
or as when as it is ſaid of God, that he <hi>repented,</hi>
and was <hi>afflicted in all his peoples afflictions.</hi> All
which expreſſions were ſpoken of God, (as wee
all know) but meerely <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>after the
manner of men:</hi> ſo to convey and repreſent to our
apprehenſions, by what affections uſe to be in
parents or friends in ſuch and ſuch caſes, (what
provoke them unto ſuch and ſuch actions,) which
like effects proceede from God towards us when
he ſees us in diſtreſſe. And ſo they are ſpoken
rather <hi>per modum Effectus,</hi> then <hi>Affectus,</hi> rather by
way of like <hi>Effect,</hi> which God produceth, then by
way of ſuch Affection in Gods heart, which is not
capable of any ſuch paſſions as theſe are. Now
towards the right underſtanding of this, the firſt
thing which I affirme is, that (barely) in ſuch a ſenſe
as this, that which is here ſpoken of Chriſt, is
not to be underſtood; and my reaſon for it is
grounded upon theſe two things put together:
Firſt, that this affection of his towards us here
ſpoken of, is manifeſtly meant of his <hi>humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and not of his God head only, for it is ſpoken
of that nature wherein he once was <hi>tempted</hi> as we
now are. So expreſly in the next words, which
can be meant of no other then his humane nature.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="112" facs="tcp:155276:183"/>
And Secondly, That thoſe kind of expreſſions
which were uſed of God before the Aſſumption
of our nature, onely in a way of metaphor and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
(<hi>after the manner of men</hi>) ſhould in no
further, or more reall and proper ſenſe be ſpoken
of Chriſt and his humane nature now aſſumed, &amp;
when he is a man as truly and properly as we are,
I cannot imagine; when I conſider and remember
that which I laſt inſiſted on, that one end of
Chriſts taking an humane nature, was, <hi>that hee
might be a [mercifull] High-Prieſt for ever;</hi> in ſuch
a way, as he being God alone, could not have
beene. I confeſſe I have often wondred at that
expreſſion there uſed, <hi>Heb. 2. He tooke the ſeede
of Abraham, that he might he made a mercifull high-Prieſt,</hi>
which at the firſt reading, ſounded, as if
God had beene made more mercifull by taking
our nature. But this ſolved the wonder, that this
aſſumption added a new way of Gods being
mercifull: By meanes of which it may now bee
ſaid, (for the comfort and reliefe of our faith)
that God is truly and really mercifull, <hi>as a man.</hi>
And the conſideration of this, contributes this to
the clearing of the thing in hand, that whereas
God of himſelfe was ſo bleſſed and perfect, that
his bleſſedneſſe could not have beene touched
with the leaſt feeling of our infirmities; neither
was he in himſelfe capable of any ſuch affection
of pitty, or compaſſion; <hi>He is not as a man that he
ſhould pittie or repent, &amp;c.</hi> He can indeed doe that
for us in our diſtreſſe, which a man that pitties us
uſeth to do: but the affections and bowels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:155276:183"/>
he is not capable of. Hence therfore
amongſt other ends of aſſuming mans nature,
this fell in before God as one, that God might
thereby become loving and mercifull unto men,
as one man is to another. And ſo, that what
before was but <hi>improperly</hi> ſpoken, and by way of
<hi>Metaphor</hi> and ſimilitude in the Old Teſtament,
ſo to convey it to our apprehenſions, might
now be truly attributed unto him in the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
that God might be for ever ſaid to be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsionate
as a man,</hi> and to be <hi>touched with a feeling
of our infirmities as a man.</hi> And thus by this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
union of both Natures, the language of the
Old Teſtament uttered onely in a figure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
verified and fulfilled in the truth of it, as
in all other things the ſhadows of it were in Chriſt
fulfilled. And this is the firſt ſtep towards the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of what is here ſaid of Chriſt, taken
from this compariſon with the like attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God himſelfe.</p>
                        <p>A ſecond and further ſtep to let in our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
to the apprehenſion of this, is by the like
further compariſon to be made with the Angels,
and thoſe affections of love and pity that are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
found in them. In compariſon of which,
theſe affections in Chriſts humane nature, (though
glorified) muſt needs be far more like to ours,
even more tender, and more humane: For in that
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>He</hi> therefore <hi>took not the
nature of the Angels, that he might be a mercifull High-Prieſt.</hi>
Part of the intendment of thoſe words
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:155276:184"/>
is to ſhew and give the reaſon, not onely why he
took our nature under fraile fleſh, (though that the
Apoſtle mentions, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.) but why an humane
nature for the ſubſtance of it, and not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Angels: Becauſe in his affections of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
he would for ever come neerer to us, and have
ſuch affections, and of the ſame kind with ours.
Whereas otherwiſe in other reſpects, an Angel
would have been an higher and more glorious
High-Prieſt then a man.</p>
                        <p>Now the Angels being <hi>fellow-ſervants</hi> with us,
(as the Angel called himſelf, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 9.) they have
affections towards us more aſſimilated unto ours
then God hath; and ſo are more capable of
ſuch impreſſions from our miſeries, then God is.
Although they be <hi>Spirits,</hi> yet they partake of
ſomething analogicall, or reſembling and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to thoſe affections of pity, griefe, &amp;c. which
are in us. And indeed, ſo far as theſe affections are
ſeated in our ſoules, and not drencht in the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the body, (unto which our ſoules are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
they are the very ſame kind of affections in us,
that are in them. Hence the <hi>ſame luſts</hi> that are in
<hi>men,</hi> are ſaid to be in <hi>devils, John</hi> 8. 44. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>devils</hi> alſo are ſaid to <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>tremble,</hi>
&amp;c. And ſo (oppoſitely) the ſame affections that
are in men, ſo far as they are ſpirituall, and the
ſpirit or ſoule is the ſeat of them, they muſt needs
be found in the good Angels. But Chriſt having
an humane nature, the ſame for ſubſtance that
ours is, conſiſting both of ſoule and body, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
through glory made <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:155276:184"/>
a <hi>Spirit, (A Spirit hath not fleſh and bones
as ye ſee me have,</hi> ſayes Chriſt of himſelfe, after
his Reſurrection, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 39.) therefore he muſt
need, have affections towards us yet more, like to
theſe of ours then thoſe are which the Angels
have. So then by theſe two ſteps we have gained
theſe two things, That even in Chriſts humane
nature, (though glorified) affections of pity and
compaſſion are true and reall, and not metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
attributed to him as they are unto God;
and alſo more neere and like unto ours here then
thoſe in the Angels are; even affections proper
to mans nature, and truly humane. And theſe
he ſhould have had, although this humane nature
had from the very firſt aſſumption of it been as
glorious as it is now in heaven.</p>
                        <p>But now thirdly, adde this (further) that God
ſo ordered it, that before Chriſt ſhould cloathe
this his humane nature with that glory he hath in
heaven, and put this glory upon it, he ſhould firſt
take it as cloathed with all our infirmities, even
the very ſame that doe cleave unto us, and ſhould
live in this world as we doe for many yeeres. And
during that time, God prepared for him all ſorts
of afflictions and miſeries to run through, which
we our ſelves doe here meet withall; and all that
time he was acquainted with, and inured unto all
the like ſorrowes that we are: and God left him
to that infirmity and tenderneſſe of ſpirit, to take
in all diſtreſſes as deeply as any of us, (without ſin)
and to exerciſe the very ſame affections under all
theſe diſtreſſes that we at any time doe find ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:155276:185"/>
in our hearts: And this God thus ordered,
on purpoſe thereby to fit him, and to frame his
heart (when he ſhould be in glory) unto ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
as theſe, ſpoken of in the Text. And this
both this Text ſuggeſts to be Gods end in it, as
alſo that fore-mentioned place, <hi>Heb. 2. 13. For as
much as we</hi> (namely, his members) <hi>are partakers
of fleſh and bloud,</hi> (which phraſe doth ever note
out the frailties of mans nature, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50.
&amp;c.) <hi>he himſelfe tooke part of the ſame,—that he
might be a mercifull High-Prieſt, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 17. And
then the Apoſtle gives this reaſon of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 18.
[<hi>For in that himſelfe hath ſuffered, being tempted, he
is able</hi> (this <hi>Ability</hi> is (as was before interpreted)
the having an heart fitted and enabled, out of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
to pity and) <hi>to ſuccour them that are
tempted.</hi>] The meaning of which is, that it was
not the bare taking of an humane nature (if glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
from the firſt) that would thus fully have
fitted him to be affectionately pitifull out of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
(though (as was ſaid) the knowledge of
our miſeries taken in thereby, would have made
him truly and really affectionate towards us, with
affections humane and proper to a man; and ſo,
much neerer and liker ours then what are in the
Angels themſelves, or then are attributed to God,
when he is ſaid to pity us) but further, his taking
our nature at firſt cloathed with frailties, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in this world as we; This hath for ever fitted
his heart by experience to be in our very hearts
and boſomes; and not onely or barely to know
the diſtreſſe, and as a man to be affected with an
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:155276:185"/>
humane affection to one of his kind; but experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,
remembring the like in himſelfe once.
And this likewiſe the Text ſuggeſts as the way
whereby our diſtreſſes are let into his heart the
more feelingly, now he is in heaven. <hi>We have
not an High-Prieſt that cannot be touched with the
feeling of our infirmities, [but was in all points tempted
like as we are, yet without ſinne.</hi>] And the more to
comfort us herein, obſerve how fully and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Chriſts having beene
tempted here below. Firſt, for the <hi>matter</hi> of
them, or the ſeverall ſorts of temptations, he
ſayes he was tempted <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>in all points,</hi> or things
of any kind, wherewith we are exereiſed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
for the <hi>manner,</hi> (he addes that too)
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>like as we are.</hi> His heart having been
juſt <hi>ſo</hi> affected, <hi>ſo</hi> wounded, pierced, and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
in all ſuch tryals as ours uſe to be, onely
<hi>without ſinne.</hi> God (on purpoſe) left all his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to their full tenderneſſe, and quickneſſe of
ſenſe of evill. So that Chriſt took to heart all
that befell him, as deeply as might be; he ſlighted
no croſſe either from God or men, but had
and felt the utmoſt load of it. Yea his heart was
made more tender in all ſorts of affections then
any of ours, (even as it was in love and pity)
and this made him <hi>a man of ſorrows;</hi> and that more
then anyother man was, or ſhall be.</p>
                        <p>Now therefore, to explicate the <hi>way</hi> how our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
are let into his heart, &amp; come to ſtir up ſuch
kindly affections of pity and compaſſion in him, it
is not hard to conceive from what hath now been
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:155276:186"/>
ſaid, and from what the Text doth further hint
unto us.</p>
                        <p>1. The underſtanding and knowledge of that
humane nature hath notice and cogniſance of all
the occurrences that befall his members here.
And for this the Text is cleare: For the Apoſtle
ſpeaks this for our encouragement, That <hi>Chriſt is
toucht with the feeling of our infirmities.</hi> Which
could not be a reliefe unto us, if it ſuppoſed not
this, that he particularly and diſtinctly knew
them; And if not all as well as ſome, we ſhould
want reliefe in all, as not knowing which he knew,
and which not. And the Apoſtle affirmes this of
his humane nature, (as was ſaid) for he ſpeaks of
that nature that was <hi>tempted</hi> here below. And
therefore <hi>the Lambe that was ſlaine,</hi> and ſo <hi>the man
Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> is <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. 6. ſaid to have <hi>ſeven eyes,</hi> as
well as <hi>ſeven hornes;</hi> which ſeven eyes are <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſpirits ſent forth into all the earth.</hi> His eyes of
Providence (through his annointing with the
Holy Ghoſt,) are in all corners of the world, and
view all the things that are done under the ſunne;
in like manner hee is there ſaid to have <hi>ſeven
hornes</hi> for power, as <hi>ſeven eyes</hi> for knowledge;
and both are defined to be <hi>ſeven,</hi> to ſhew the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of both; in their extent, reaching unto all
things: So that, as <hi>all power in heaven and earth is
committed unto Him</hi> as <hi>Son of man,</hi> (as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeakes,) ſo all knowledge is given him of
all things done in heaven and earth, and this as
Son of man too: his knowledge and power being
of equall extent. He is the <hi>Sunne</hi> as well in reſpect
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:155276:186"/>
of <hi>knowledge,</hi> as of <hi>Righteouſneſſe,</hi> and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hid from his light and beames, which doe
pierce the darkeſt corners of the hearts of the
ſons of men: He knowes the <hi>ſores</hi> (as <hi>Solomon ex</hi>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
it) and diſtreſſes of their hearts. Like as a
looking-glaſſe made into the forme of a round
globe, and hung in the midſt of a roome, takes in
all the ſpecies of things done or that are therein
at once; ſo doth the enlarged underſtanding of
Chriſts humane nature, take in the affairs of this
world, (which hee is appointed to governe:) eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
the miſeries of his members; and this at
once.</p>
                        <p>2. His humane nature thus knowing all, [<hi>I know
thy workes, thy labour, and thy patience, &amp;c. Rev.</hi> 22.]
He therewithall hath an act of memory, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls
how himſelf was once affected, and how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
whilſt on earth, under the ſame or the
like miſeries: For the memory of things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
remaines ſtill with him, as with all ſpirits in
either of thoſe two other worlds, heaven or hell.

(ſayes Chriſt) <hi>that was dead, and am alive:</hi> Hee
remembers his death ſtill, and the ſufferings
of it; and as he remembers it, to put his Father in
mind thereof, ſo he remembers it alſo, to affect
his owne heart with what we feele: And his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
preſenting the impreſſion of the like now
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:155276:187"/>
afreſh unto him, how it was once with him; hence
he comes feelingly and experimentally to know
how it is now with us, and ſo affects himſelfe
therewith: as <hi>Dido</hi> in <hi>Virgil, Haud ignara mali mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeris
ſuccurrere diſco:</hi> Having experience of the like
miſeries, (though a Queene now) I know how to
ſuccour thoſe that are therein: As God ſaid to
the Iſraelites when they ſhould be poſſeſſed of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>
their own land, <hi>Exo. 23. 9. Ye know the
hearts of ſtrangers, ſeeing ye were ſtrangers, &amp;c.</hi> and
therefore doth command them to pitty ſtrangers,
and to uſe them well upon that motive: So may
it be ſaid of CHRIST, that he doth know <hi>the
hearts of his children</hi> in miſery, ſeeing himſelfe was
once under the like. Or as the Apoſtle exhorts
the Hebrews, <hi>Heb. 13. 3. Remember them that are
in bonds, as bound with them, and them that ſuffer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
as being your ſelves [in the body,</hi>] and ſo ere
you die, may come to ſuffer the like. So Chriſt,
the <hi>Head</hi> of the body, (which is the fountaine of
all ſenſe, and feeling in the body) doth remember
them that are bound and in adverſity, having
himſelfe beene <hi>once in the body;</hi> and ſo he experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
compaſſionates them. And this is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing then the former: We have gained this
further, That Chriſt hath not onely ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as are reall and proper to an humane nature,
but ſuch affections as are ſtirred up in him, from
experience of the like by himſelfe once taſted in a
fraile nature like unto ours. And thus much for
the <hi>way</hi> of letting in all our miſeries into Chriſts
heart now, ſo as to ſtrike and affect it with
them.</p>

or <hi>ſuffering with,</hi> (as the Text calls it) which
is the product, reſult, or thing produced in his

more particularly to be inquired into; namely,
<hi>What manner of affection</hi> this is. For that ſuch an
affection is ſtirred up in him, beſides and beyond
a bare act of knowledge, or remembrance how
once it was with himſelfe, is evident by what
we find in the Text. The Apoſtle ſayes, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he remembers how himſelfe was tempted
with the like infirmities that we are, (though that
be neceſſarily ſuppoſed) but that he is ſtruck and
<hi>toucht with the feeling of our infirmities;</hi> to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of which, this act of remembrance doth
but ſubſerve. And he tels us, Chriſt is <hi>able,</hi> and
his heart is capable of thus being toucht. And the
word [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>] is a deep word, ſignifying to
<hi>ſuffer with us,</hi> untill we are relieved. And this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
thus ſtirred up, is it which moveth
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:155276:188"/>
him ſo cordially to helpe us.</p>
                        <p>Now concerning this affection, (as here thus
expreſſed) how far it extends, and how deep it
may reach, I think no man in this life can fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome.
If <hi>Cor Regis, the heart of a King be inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi>
(as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks) the heart of the King of
Kings now in glory is much more. I will not take
upon me to <hi>intrude into things which I have not ſeen,</hi>
but ſhall endeavour to ſpeak ſafely, and therefore
warily, ſo far as the light of Scripture and right
reaſon ſhall warrant my way.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall ſet it forth three wayes:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Negatively.</item>
                           <item>2. Poſitively.</item>
                           <item>3. Privatively.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. <hi>Negatively:</hi> It is certaine that this affection
of ſympathie or fellow-feeling in Chriſt is not in
all things ſuch a kind of affection as was in
him <hi>in the dayes of his fleſh.</hi> Which is cleare, by
what the Apoſtle ſpeaks of him and of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
then, <hi>Heb. 5. 7. Who in the dayes of his fleſh
when he had offered up prayers and ſupplications with
ſtrong cryings and teares, was heard in that which he
feared.</hi> Where we ſee his converſe and ſtate of
life here below, to be called by way of difference
and diſtinction from what it is now in heaven,
[<hi>The dayes of his fleſh:</hi>] By [<hi>fleſh</hi>] meaning not
the ſubſtance of the humane nature, for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
that ſtill; but the fraile quality of ſubjection
to mortality, or paſſibility. So [<hi>Fleſh</hi>] is uſually
taken; as when <hi>all fleſh</hi> is ſaid to <hi>be graſſe:</hi> It is
ſpoken of mans nature, in reſpect to its being
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:155276:188"/>
ſubject to a fading, wearing, and decay, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
caſualties, or inward paſſions. So in this
Epiſtle, <hi>Chap. 2. 14. For as much as the children</hi> (we
his brethren) <hi>did partake of fleſh and bloud,</hi> (that is,
the frailties of mans nature) <hi>he himſelfe alſo took part
of the ſame.</hi> And accordingly the Apoſtle inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
in the following words of that 14. <hi>verſe,</hi>
as in <hi>death,</hi> (which in the dayes of his fleſh
Chriſt was ſubject to) ſo alſo in ſuch fraile paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and affections as did work a ſuffering in him,
and a wearing and waſting of his ſpirits; ſuch as
paſſionate <hi>ſorrow,</hi> joyned with <hi>ſtrong cryes</hi> and
<hi>teares,</hi> (both which he mentioneth) and alſo <hi>feare,</hi>
(in thoſe words) [<hi>He was heard in that which he
feared.</hi>] Now theſe <hi>dayes of his fleſh</hi> being over and
paſt, (for this was onely (as ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>in
the dayes of his fleſh</hi>) hence therefore all ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
paſſionate overflowings of <hi>ſorrow, feare,</hi>
&amp;c. are ceaſed therewith, and he is now no way
capable of them, or ſubjected to them.</p>
                        <p>Yet (2.) <hi>Poſitively,</hi> why may it not be affirmed
that for ſubſtance the ſame kinde of affection of
pittie and compaſſion, that wrought in his whole
man both body and ſoule, when he was here,
workes ſtill in him now he is in heaven? (If this
Poſition be allayed with thoſe due cautions and
conſiderations which preſently I ſhall annexe)
For, if for ſubſtance the ſame <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> and
animall ſpirits remaine and have their uſe; (for
though Chriſt in <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 29. mentioned only his
having <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>bones</hi> after his reſurrection, unto
<hi>Thomas</hi> and the other Diſciples, becauſe theſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:155276:189"/>
two alone were to be the object of his Touch and
Feeling; yet <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> are included in that
<hi>fleſh,</hi> for it is <hi>caro vitalis, living fleſh,</hi> and therefore
hath Blood and Spirits that flow and move in it,)
then why not the ſame affections alſo? and thoſe
not ſtirring only and meerely in the ſoule, but
working in the body alſo, unto which that ſoule is
joyned, and ſo, remaining really humane affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
The uſe of bloud and ſpirits is, as to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
(which end is now ceaſed) ſo to affect the
heart and bowels by their motion to and fro,
when the ſoule is affected. And why this uſe of
them ſhould not remaine, (and if not this, we can
conceive no other) I know not. Neither why this
affection ſhould be onely reſtrained to his ſpirit
or ſoule, and his corporeall powers not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to communicate and partake in them. That
ſo, as he is a true man, and the ſame man that he
was, both in body as well as in ſoule, (for elſe
it had not been a true Reſurrection) ſo he hath
ſtill the very ſame true humane affections in
them both: and ſuch, as whereof the body is the
ſeat (and inſtrument) as well as the ſoule. And
ſeeing this whole man both body and ſoule was
tempted, and that (as the Text ſayes) he is <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a feeling</hi> in that nature which is tempted,
it muſt therefore be in the whole man, both body
and ſoule. Therefore when as we reade of the
<hi>wrath of the Lambe,</hi> as <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 16. (namely, againſt
his enemies) as here, of his pity and compaſſion
(towards his friends and members) why ſhould
this be attributed onely to his Deity, (which is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:155276:189"/>
not capable of wrath) or to his ſoule and ſpirit
onely? And why may it not be thought he is
truly angry as a man, in his whole man, and ſo
with ſuch a wrath as his body is affected with, as
well as that he is wrathfull in his ſoule onely; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he hath taken up our whole nature, on purpoſe
to ſubſerve his Divine nature in all the executions
of it?</p>
                        <p>But now, how far (in our apprehenſions of
this) we are to cut off the weakneſſe and frailty of
ſuch affections as in the dayes of his fleſh was in
them, and how exactly to difference thoſe which
Chriſt had here, and thoſe which he hath in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
therein lyes the difficulty; and I can ſpeak
but little unto it.</p>
                        <p>Yet firſt, this we may lay downe as an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Maxime, That ſo far, or in what ſenſe his
Body it ſelf is made <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> (as it is called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15. 44.) ſo far, and in that ſenſe all ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as thus working in his Body are made <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;</hi>
and that in an oppoſition to that fleſhly and
fraile way of their working here. But then, as his
Body is made <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> not <hi>Spirit, (ſpirituall</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of power, and likeneſſe to a Spirit, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of ſubſtance or nature) ſo theſe affections
of pity and compaſſion doe work not onely in his
<hi>Spirit</hi> or Soule, but in his Body too, as their ſeat
and inſtrument, though in a more ſpirituall way
of working, and more like to that of Spirits, then
thoſe in a fleſhly fraile body are. They are not
wholly ſpirituall in this ſenſe, that the ſoule is the
ſole ſubject of them, and that it drawes up all
ſuch workings into it ſelfe: ſo that <hi>that</hi> ſhould
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:155276:190"/>
be the difference between his affections now, and
in the dayes of his fleſh. Men are not to conceive,
as if his body were turned into ſuch a ſubſtance
as the Sun is of, for the ſoule (as through a caſe
of glaſſe) to ſhine gloriouſly in onely; but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is united to the ſoule, to be <hi>acted</hi> by it,
(though immediately,) for the ſoul to produce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
in it. And it is called <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> not that
it remains not a body, but becauſe it remains not
ſuch a body; but is ſo framed to the ſoule, that
both it ſelfe and all the operations of all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
in it, are immediately and entirely at the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
<hi>imperium</hi> &amp; dominion of the ſoule; &amp; that,
as the ſoule is pleaſed to uſe it, and to ſway it and
move it, even as immediately and as nimbly (and
without any clog or impediment) as an Angel
moves it ſelfe, or as the ſoule acteth it ſelfe. So
that this may perhaps be one difference, that
theſe affections, ſo far as in the body of Chriſt,
doe not affect his ſoule, (as here they did, though
as then under the command of Grace and Reaſon
to keep their motions from being inordinate or
ſinfull) but further, the ſoule being now too ſtrong
for them, doth as its owne arbitrement raiſe them,
and as entirely and immediately ſtir them as it
doth it ſelfe.</p>
                        <p>Hence 2. theſe affections of pity and ſympathie
ſo ſtirred up by himſelfe, though they move his
bowels, and affect his bodily heart as they did
here; yet they doe not afflict and perturbe him in
the leaſt, nor become they a burthen &amp; a load un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his ſpirit, ſo as to make him <hi>ſorrowfull,</hi> or <hi>heavy,</hi>
(as in this life here his pity unto <hi>Lazarus</hi> made
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:155276:190"/>
him, and as his diſtreſſes at laſt, that made him
<hi>ſorrowfull unto death.</hi>) So that, as in their riſe, ſo in
their effect, they utterly differ from what they
were here below. And the reaſon of this is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his Body, and the blood and ſpirits thereof,
(the inſtruments of affecting him) are now alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
impaſſible; namely, in this ſenſe, that they
are not capable of the leaſt alteration tending to
any hurt what ever: And ſo, his body is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to any griefe, nor his ſpirits to any waſt, decay
or expence. They may, and doe ſubſerve the
ſoule in its affections, as they did whilſt he was
here; but this, meerly by a locall motion, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to and fro in the veynes and arteries, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the heart and bowels, without the leaſt
diminution or impaire to themſelves, or detriment
to him: And thus it comes to paſſe, that though
this Blood and ſpirits doe ſtir up the ſame affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in his heart and bowels, which here they did,
yet not (as then) with the leaſt perturbation in
himſelfe, or inconvenience unto himſelfe: But
as in this life he was troubled and grieved [<hi>without
ſinne,</hi>] or inordinancie; ſo now when he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
he pitties and compaſſionates <hi>without</hi> the
leaſt mixture or tang of diſquietement and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation</hi>
(which yet neceſſarily accompanied his
affections whilſt he was here, becauſe of the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in which his body and ſpirits were framed:)
His perfection <hi>deſtroyes</hi> not his affections, but
onely <hi>corrects</hi> and amends the imperfection of
them. <hi>Paſsiones perfectivas</hi> to bee now in him,
the beſt of Schoolemen doe acknowledge.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="128" facs="tcp:155276:191"/>
Thirdly, All naturall affections that have not
in them <hi>Indecentiam ſtatus,</hi> ſomething unbefitting
that ſtate and condition of glory wherein Chriſt
now is, both Schoole-men and other Divines
doe acknowledge to be in him. <hi>Humanae affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones
quae naturales ſunt, neque cum probro vel peccato
conjunctae, ſed omni ex parte rationi ſubduntur; denique
ab iis conditionibus liberantur quae vel animo, vel cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pori
aliquo modo officiunt, Beatis nequaquam repugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
cenſendae ſunt.</hi> 
                           <q>Thoſe affections which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
to man, and have no adhaeſion of ſinne or
ſhame unto them, but are wholly governed by
reaſon, and laſtly are exempt from ſuch effects
as may any way hurt either the ſoule or the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
there is no ground to thinke that ſuch affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
may not wel ſtand with the ſtate of ſouls
in bliſſe, ſayes <hi>Juſtinian</hi> upon this place.</q> Now if
we conſider it, Chriſt his very <hi>ſtate</hi> in glory is ſuch,
as it becomes him to have ſuch humane affections
of pity and compaſſion in his whole man; ſo far
as to quicken and provoke him to our helpe and
ſuccour: not ſuch as to make him <hi>a man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes</hi>
in himſelfe again, (that were uncomely,
nay, incompatible to him,) but ſuch as ſhould
make him a <hi>man of ſuccours</hi> unto us, which is
his office. To this end it is to bee remembred,
that Chriſt in heaven is to be conſidered, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
only as in himſelfe made happy in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but withall in his relations and in his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as an <hi>Head</hi> unto us, and in that relation hee
now ſits there, as 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 21. 22. (and the head is
the ſeat of all the ſenſes for the good of the body;)
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:155276:191"/>
and therefore moſt ſenſible of any other part.
Wherefore becauſe his members unto whom he
beares this relation, are ſtill under ſinne and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie,
therefore it is no way uncomely for him in
that eſtate, to have affections ſuitable to this his
relation. If his ſtate of glory had been wholly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for his owne perſonall happineſſe, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
there had beene no uſe of ſuch affections to
remaine in him; but his relation to us being one
part and ingredient of his glory; therfore they are
moſt proper for him: yea, it were uncomely if he
had them not. Neither are they a weakneſſe in
him, as ſo conſidered; but rather part of his <hi>ſtrength</hi>
(as the Apoſtle calls them) [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>] And although
ſuch affections might in one reſpect be thought an
imperfection; yet in another reſpect, (namely, his
relation to us, and office for us) they are his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
As he is our Head, (which he is as he is
a man) it is his glory to be truly and really (even
as a man) ſenſible of all our miſeries; Yea it were
his imperfection if he were not.</p>
                        <p>And 4. let me adde this for our comfort, that
though all ſuch affections as are any way a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
to his ſpirit, or noxious to his body, be not
now compatible to him; and though that paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
frailty and infirmity which did help him here
to pity and relieve men in miſery, out of a ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
hurtfull to himſelfe; though theſe be
cut off: yet in thoſe workings of affections and
bowels, which he hath now, (which for ſubſtance
are the ſame) there is (inſtead of that paſſionate
frailty) a greater capaciouſneſſe, vaſtneſſe, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:155276:192"/>
alſo quickneſſe in his affections now in heaven, ſo
to make up a compenſation; &amp; ſo no leſſe effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to ſtir and quicken him to relieve us, then
thoſe former affections did. For it is certaine, that
as his knowledge was enlarged upon his entring
into glory; ſo his humane affections of love &amp; pity
are enlarged in ſolidity, ſtrength, and reality, (as
true conjugall love uſeth to be, though more paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
haply at firſt.) They are not leſſe now, but
are onely made more ſpirituall. And as <hi>Solomons</hi>
heart was as large in bounty and royalty, as in
knowledge; ſo Chriſts affections of Love are as
large as his Knowledge or his Power: They are
all of a like extent and meaſure. So far as Gods
intention to ſhew mercy doth reach, (and who
knowes the end of thoſe riches?) ſo farre doth
Chriſts diſpoſition to beſtow it. <hi>Epheſ. 3. 19. The
Love of Chriſt,</hi> God-man, <hi>paſſeth knowledge.</hi> It
hath not loſt, or beene diminiſhed by his going to
heaven. Though God in his <hi>nature</hi> be more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
then Chriſts humane nature; yet the <hi>act</hi> and
exerciſe of Chriſts affections is as large as Gods
purpoſes and decrees of mercy are. And all thoſe
large affections and mercies are become humane
mercies; the mercies of a Man unto men.</p>
                        <p>3. Privatively. If theſe affections of Chriſts
heart be not ſuffering and afflicting affections; yet
we may be way of <hi>Privation</hi> expreſſe this of them,
that there is a leſſe fulneſſe of joy and comfort in
Chriſs heart, wſtilſt he ſees us in miſery and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
infirmities, comparatively to what will be
when we are preſented to him free of them all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="131" facs="tcp:155276:192"/>
To cleare this, I muſt recall (and I ſhall but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call)
that Diſtinction I made (in the 4. Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
<hi>Sect. 2. Part</hi> 2.) of a double capacity of
Glory, or a double fulneſſe of Joy which Chriſt
is ordained to have: The one Naturall, and ſo
due unto his perſon as in himſelfe alone conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
The other Additionall, and ariſing from the
compleated happineſſe and glory of his whole
Church, (wherewith myſtically he is one.) So in
<hi>Epheſ. 1. ult.</hi> although he by reaſon of his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
fulneſſe is there ſaid to <hi>fill all in all;</hi> yet as he
is an <hi>Head,</hi> in relation to his Church as his body
(as in the verſes before he is ſpoken of) thus the
perfection of this his bodies beatitude, it is reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally
called <hi>his fulneſſe;</hi> and therefore untill
he hath filled them with all happineſſe, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
them from all miſerie, himſelfe remaines
under ſome kinde of imperfection, and anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
his affections alſo (which are ſuited to this his
relation,) have ſome want of imperfection in
them, whilſt theylie under miſerie, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of what his heart ſhall have when they
receive this fulneſſe. Wee may warrantably ſay
Chriſt ſhall bee more gladde then, (and is
now) as his children are growne up from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their infirmities, and as they doe become
more obedient and comfortable in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
ſo <hi>John</hi> 15. 10, 11. I ſhall adde ſome il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration
to this by this ſimilitude (which though
it hold not in all things, yet it will hold forth ſome
ſhadowe of it) The <hi>ſpirits of juſt men,</hi> departed,
are ſaid to be <hi>perfect, Heb.</hi> 12. yet becauſe they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:155276:193"/>
have bodies unto which they have a relation,
and unto which they are ordained to bee united,
they in this reſpect may be ſaid to be imperfect,
till theſe bodies be re-united and glorified with
them, which will adde a further fulneſſe to them.
Thus in ſome analogie it ſtands between Chriſt
Perſonall, and Chriſt Myſticall conſidered. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Chriſt in his owne <hi>Perſon</hi> be compleat in
happineſſe; yet in relation to his members he is
imperfect, and ſo accordingly hath affections
ſuited unto this his relation: which is no deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from him at all. The Scripture therefore at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
ſome affections to him which have an
imperfection joyned with them; and thoſe to be
in him, untill the day of judgement. Thus <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi>
and <hi>Deſire,</hi> (which are but imperfect af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in compariſon to that joy which is in the
full fruition of what was expected or deſired) are
attributed to him, as he is man, untill the day of
Judgement. Thus <hi>Heb. 10. 12, 13. He</hi> is ſaid to <hi>ſit</hi> in
heaven, <hi>expecting till his enemies be made his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole.</hi>
The deſtruction of which enemies will adde
to the manifeſtative glory of his kingdome. Now
as that will adde to the fulneſſe of his greatneſſe;
ſo the compleat ſalvation of his members will add
to the compleatneſſe of his glory. And as the
expectation of his enemies ruine maybe ſaid to be
an imperfect affection, in compariſon of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
that one day he ſhall have over them: ſo
his joy which he now hath in his Spouſe, is but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
in compariſon of that which ſhall fill his
heart at the great day of Marriage. And acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:155276:193"/>
the Scripture calls the accompliſhment
of theſe his deſires a <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> ſo <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63. 11.
<hi>He ſhall ſee of the travaile of his ſoule and be ſatisfied,</hi>
which argues deſires to be in him, lying under a
want of ſomething in the end to bee obtained:
Onely we muſt take in this withall, that Jeſus
Chriſt indeede knowes and ſees the very time
when this his fulneſſe through the exaltation of
his members up to himſelfe ſhall bee complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and when he ſhall trample upon the necks of
all his and their enemies; Hee <hi>ſees their day a
comming,</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt hath it,) which alleviates
and detracts ſomething from this imperfection,
that hee ſhould thus <hi>expect</hi> or <hi>tarrie.</hi>

                        <p>THere remaines one great unſatisfaction to be
removed, which cannot but of it ſelfe ariſe
in every good heart. You told us, (may they

that the Apoſtles ſcope was to encourage us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

diſcomforts and diſcouragements of all
other) Now againſt them, this which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
here ſpeakes affordeth us but little, ſeeing
Chriſt knowes not how experimentally to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:155276:194"/>
us therein, for <hi>he knew no ſinne:</hi> Yea, the
Apoſtle himſelfe doth here except it, <hi>Hee was
tempted in all things, [yet without ſinne.</hi>] It may
comfort us indeede, that Chriſt doth and will
pittie us in all other infirmities, becauſe hee
himſelfe was ſubject to the like; but hee never
knew what it was to bee under ſinne, and vexed
with a luſt, (as I am,) and how ſhall I releeve
my ſelfe againſt that, by what the Apoſtle here
ſpeakes of him? I ſhall endeavour to give ſome
ſatisfaction and reliefe in this, by theſe following
conſiderations.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, The Apoſtle puts in indeede, that <hi>hee
was tempted [yet without ſinne,</hi>] and it was well for
us that he was thus without ſinne, for he had not
beene a fit Prieſt to have ſaved us elſe: ſo <hi>Heb.</hi>
7. 25. <hi>Such an High-Prieſt became us as was ſeparate
from ſinners, innocent, &amp;c.</hi> Yet for your reliefe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
conſider, that hee came as neer in that point
as might be, [<hi>he was tempted in all things</hi>] ſo ſayes
the Text, though <hi>without ſinne</hi> on his part; yet
tempted <hi>to all ſinne,</hi> ſo far as to bee afflicted in
thoſe temptations, and to ſee the miſerie of thoſe
that are tempted, and to know how to pittie them
in all ſuch temptations. Even as in taking our
nature, in his birth, he came as neere as could be,
without being tainted with originall ſin, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by taking the very ſame matter to have his
body made of that all ours are made of, &amp;c. So
in the point of actuall ſinne alſo he ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to bee tempted as far as might be, ſo as to
keepe himſelfe pure. He ſuffered all experiments
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:155276:194"/>
to be tryed upon him by Satan, even as a man
who hath taken a ſtrong antidote, ſuffers conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to be tryed on him by a Mountibanke. And
indeede becauſe hee was thus tempted by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
unto ſinne, therefore it is on purpoſe added,
[<hi>yet without ſinne,</hi>] And it is as if he had ſaid,
ſinne never ſtained him, though hee was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
tempted to it. Hee was tempted to all
ſorts of ſins by Satan, for thoſe three tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the wilderneſſe were the heads of all ſorts
of temptations, (as Interpreters upon the Goſpels
do ſhew.)</p>
                        <p>Then Secondly, To fit him to pittie us in caſe
of ſinne, he was vext with the filth and power
of ſinne in others whom he converſed with, more
then any of us with ſinne in our ſelves. His <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
ſoule was vexed</hi> with it, as <hi>Lots</hi> righteous
ſoule is ſaid to have been with the impure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of the Sodomites. He <hi>endured the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
of ſinners</hi> againſt himſelfe, <hi>Heb. 12. 3. the
reproaches of them that reproached thee,</hi> (that is, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his God,) <hi>fell upon me, Rom.</hi> 15. 3. It was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the Pſalmiſt of Chriſt, and ſo is quoted
of him by the Apoſtle: that is, every ſinne went to
his heart. So as in this, there is but this difference
betwixt him and us, that the regenerate part in us
is vexed with ſin in our ſelves, and that as our own
ſin; but his heart with ſin in others onely: yet ſo, as
his vexation was the greater, by how much his
ſoule was more righteous then ours which makes
it up; yea, in that he ſuſtained the perſons of the
elect, the ſinnes which he ſaw them commit, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:155276:195"/>
him, as if they had beene his owne.

                        </p>
                        <p>Yea, and Thirdly, to helpe this alſo, it may be
ſaid of Chriſt whilſt he was here below, that in
the ſame ſenſe or manner wherein hee <hi>bore our
ſickneſſes, Mat.</hi> 8. 17. (who yet was never perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
tainted with any diſeaſe) in the ſame ſenſe
or manner he may be ſaid to have borne our ſins,
namely thus, Chriſt when hee came to an elect
child of his that was ſick, whom he healed; his
manner was, firſt by a ſympathie &amp; pittie to afflict
himſelfe with their ſickneſſe, as if it had beene
his owne: Thus at his raiſing of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> it is ſaid
that he <hi>groaned in ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo by the merit of
taking the diſeaſe upon himſelfe, through a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feeling
of it, he tooke it off from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for them afflicted, as if he himſelfe had beene
ſick. And this ſeemes to be the beſt interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that I have met with, of that difficult place in
<hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 16. 17. where it is ſaid, <hi>He healed all that
were ſick, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by
Iſaiah the Prophet, ſaying, Himſelfe tooke our infirmities,</hi>
[<hi>and bare our ſickneſſes.</hi>] Now in the like way or
manner unto this, of bearing our ſickneſſes, hee
might beare our ſinnes too, for hee being one
with us, and to anſwer for all our ſinnes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when he ſaw any of his owne to ſinne, hee
was affected with it, as if it had beene his own.
And thus is that about the power of ſin made up
and ſatisfied.</p>
                        <p>And fourthly, as for the guilt of ſinne, and the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:155276:195"/>
temptations from it, he knowes more of that then
any one of us. He taſted the bitterneſſe of that, in
the imputation of it, more deeply then wee can,
and of the cup of his Fathers wrath for it, and ſo
is able experimentally to pittie a heart wounded
with it, and ſtruggling under ſuch temptations. He
knowes full well the heart of one in his owne
ſenſe forſaken by God, ſeeing himſelfe felt it,
when he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou
forſaken me?</hi>

aſſurance of their being removed off from us,
that may be: for,</p>
                           <p>Firſt, Chriſt himſelfe ſuffers (as it were) at leaſt
is affected under them, as his enemies, which
therefore he will be ſure to remove, for his owne
quiet ſake. His heart would not be quiet, but that
he knowes they ſhall be removed. As God ſayes
in the Prophet, ſo may Chriſt ſay much more,
<hi>My Bowels are troubled for him, I remember him ſtill.
Jeremiah</hi> 31. 20.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, there is comfort concerning ſuch
infirmities, in that your very ſinnes move him to
pittie more then to anger. This text is plaine for
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:155276:196"/>
it, for he ſuffers with us under our infirmities,
and by infirmities are meant ſinnes, as well as
other miſeries, (as was proved) whilſt therefore
you looke on them as infirmities, (as God here
lookes upon them, and ſpeakes of them in his
owne) and as your diſeaſe, and complaine to
Chriſt of them, and doe cry out, <hi>O miſerable
man that I am, who ſhall deliver me?</hi> ſo long feare not.
Chriſt he takes part with you, and is ſo farre from
being provoked againſt you, as all his anger is
turned upon your ſinne to ruine it; yea his pity
is increaſed the more towards you, even as the
heart of a father is to a child that hath ſome
loathſome diſeaſe, or as one is to a member of his
body that hath the leproſie, hee hates not the
member, for it is his fleſh, but the diſeaſe, and
that provokes him to pittie the part affected the
more. What ſhall not make for us, when our
ſinnes that are both againſt Chriſt and us, ſhall be
turned as motives to him, to pitie us the more?
The object of pitty is one in miſerie whom we
love; and the greater the miſery is, the more is
the pity, when the party is beloved: Now of
all miſeries, ſinne is the greateſt; and whilſt your
ſelves look at it as ſuch, Chriſt will looke upon
it as ſuch only alſo in you: And he loving your
perſons, and hating only the ſinne; his hatred ſhall
all fall, and that only upon the ſinne to free you of
it by its ruine and deſtruction, but his bowels ſhall
be the more drawne out to you; and this as much
when you lie under ſin, as under any other afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Therefore feare not, <hi>What ſhall ſeparate us from
Chriſts love?</hi>

that Chriſt was once under the ſame, or ſome one

                           <p>Firſt, that we are thereby but conformed to

                           <p>Secondly, we may look to that particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
